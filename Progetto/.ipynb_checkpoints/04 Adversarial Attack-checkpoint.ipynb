      "The message of this movie is`` personality is more important than gorgeous''. Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be the`` nasty duckling'', but the funny thing is that she's not at all ugly( actually she's a multiple more exciting than Uma Thurman, the boyfriend who looks love a model). Now, would this movie work if the`` ugly duckling'' was really unattractive? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy? In my opinion, although the message that it wants to convey, this movie is simply grotesque.\n",

       "'Wow. I observed this movie and \"Up\" on the same day within an hour of each other at different theaters. I saw \"Mr Bug\" first, and was then totally disappointed in \"Up\"\\'s follow-up. What a beautiful and touching film! Movies of the 1930s and 40s to us nowadays can be irking with their melodramatic acting and dialog, but as animation the same melodrama and groaning humor can be wonderful. And the soft \"organic\" lines of 30s drawing AND the music just puts you in a nice comfortable mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters: ladybugs, grasshoppers, bees, snails, stinkbugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, crickets, and more each with all their own cute little (but not overbearing) idiosyncrasies. The interaction with the human world, from nemesis (cigar smokers, high-heel wearers, innocent kick-the-can playing kids) to the kind-hearted, and to the unknown destroyers, is realistic and fascinating. You care for the bugs, AND Dick and Mary. The protagonist Hoppity is not some perfect superman who comes to \"set things right\" but a starry-eyed optimist who leads everyone down the garden path (literally! ), and every time you think it\\'s going to end happily in 1930s style, along comes another roadblock...! I was on the edge of my seat much more than with \"Up.\" I walked out of the movie theater grinning and chuckling: something that hasn\\'t happened in a long long long long time!'"
