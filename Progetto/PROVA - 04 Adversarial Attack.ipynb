    "len(\"Wow. I saw this movie and`` Up`` on the same day within an hour of each other at different theaters. I saw`` Mr Bug`` first, and was then totally disappointed in`` Up``'s follow- up. What a beautiful and touching film! Movies of the 1930s and 40s to us nowadays can be irking with their melodramatic acting and dialog, but as animation the same melodramatic and groaning humor can be wonderful. And the soft`` organic`` lines of 30s drawing AND the music just puts you in a nice comfortable mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters: ladybugs, grasshoppers, bees, snails, stinkbugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, crickets, and more each with all their own cute little( but not overbearing) idiosyncrasies. The interaction with the human world, from nemesis( cigar smokers, high- heel wearers, innocent kick- the- can playing kids) to the kind- hearted, and to the unknown destroyers, is realistic and fascinating. You care for the bugs, AND Dick and Mary. The protagonist Hoppity is not some perfect superman who comes to`` set things right`` but a starry- eyed optimist who leads everyone down the garden path( literally! ), and every time you think it's going to end happily in 1930s style, along comes another roadblock...! I was on the edge of my seat much more than with`` Up.`` I walked out of the movie theater grinning and chuckling: something that has n't happened in a long long long long time!\")"

Pretty Young Girls In Peril. I have to give it up for the filmmaker who used a aeroplane for some of the early road- trip shots, you truly think for a second there's going to be quality in the production. Watching`` Unhinged`` was like seeing an amateur acting sorts move through it's warm- up. Some of the most awkward, urgently lit, overlong scenes are effected out with the gusto of a Valium overdose. I wondered why they did n't just put the cue- cards on camera so the actresses must n't have to constantly shift their see. The two main girls were definitely chosen for their T& A factor quite than talent. Laurel Munson as the main chick Terry is as exciting as watch painting dry. Two nude scenes rendering for an adolescent thrill. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as the crazy/ creepy daughters and mother the chickens find themselves stranded with compete for Worst Acting Ever. Long pauses, weird demonstrations, emphasis on the wrong word, it's all there and is a delight for those of us out there who love bad films. The scenes shift suddenly with long black- outs you could drive a Mack truck through. Cartoon lightning crashes across shootings without so bothering to show the sky. Eighties eyeshadow assault the viewer. But oj know, it grew on me. I saw desolated for it. I wanted to hug it, kiss it's boo- ovation and make it better. The ending does n't make up for the damage it's caused but I grinned anyway. I have my own theories regarding the ensemble`` forbidden`` hype and hope that anyone who opt to view this film does so with important substance abuse and a feel of humor.

    "black_box.predict_sentiment(\"troubled follows the typical plot of the prompt 80's slasher trend. Pretty Young Girls In Peril. I have to give it up for the filmmaker who used a aeroplane for some of the early road- trip shots, you truly think for a second there's going to be quality in the production. Watching`` Unhinged`` was like seeing an amateur acting sorts move through it's warm- up. Some of the most awkward, urgently lit, overlong scenes are effected out with the gusto of a Valium overdose. I wondered why they did n't just put the cue- cards on camera so the actresses must n't have to constantly shift their see. The two main girls were definitely chosen for their T& A factor quite than talent. Laurel Munson as the main chick Terry is as exciting as watch painting dry. Two nude scenes rendering for an adolescent thrill. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as the crazy/ creepy daughters and mother the chickens find themselves stranded with compete for Worst Acting Ever. Long pauses, weird demonstrations, emphasis on the wrong word, it's all there and is a delight for those of us out there who love bad films. The scenes shift suddenly with long black- outs you could drive a Mack truck through. Cartoon lightning crashes across shootings without so bothering to show the sky. Eighties eyeshadow assault the viewer. But oj know, it grew on me. I saw desolated for it. I wanted to hug it, kiss it's boo- ovation and make it better. The ending does n't make up for the damage it's caused but I grinned anyway. I have my own theories regarding the ensemble`` forbidden`` hype and hope that anyone who opt to view this film does so with important substance abuse and a feel of humor. Otherwise passport.\")"

It\\'s not my favorite movie but it is a movie I have enjoyed seeing more than once. Some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy Pavarotti, they would likely be better served by picking up an opera DVD. Although, a full opera might be a better representation of Pavarotti\\'s operatic talents, oftentimes, an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. \"Yes, Georgio\" permits Pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would not.Many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable; I don\\'t agree. Enormously talented people can be both self-centered and charming - charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. Additionally, people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own. Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the other.Relax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities. The ending scenes from Puccini\\'s Turandot alone are worth the time to get there.',\n",

Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay hitman Anisio (Miklos) to off their third partner (and majority share holder) in said construction outfit. The murder is blamed on the city, but things begin to look very grim indeed when witty and charismatic walking nightmare Anisio decides he wants to be around the ever so nervous partners in crime, not only trespassing but, more importantly, deconstructing the strict social codes that make up Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into an attitude and he wants in. The look is almost entirely handheld, grainy, the performances outstanding throughout, especially so as first time actor (and member of classic Brazilian pop band \\'Titãs\\'), Paulo Miklos, dazzles and baffles the viewer with his pretty funny social terror.I saw the film at the Brasília film Fest in November 2001.

Most of the action we see through the eyes of Carrere, who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates.I won't say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen.

       " ('This movie was charming. An accountant wants more from life than the approved conventional success. What makes it work so well, and makes it so different from the standard dance movie is that it really isn\\'t about becoming \"Great\" it is simply about finding a way to express one\\'s self. The big triumph at the end is not the winning of a contest, not the discovery of a whole new life style, but the simple joy of doing what you want to fulfill the other parts of your life. No one is discovering their passion, they are finding their quiet soul.The Japanese background makes the subtle oppression and \"secret life\" of ballroom dancing both understandable and personal. We can all see ourselves in the everyman.',\n",

       " ('This is my fourth review of a Charlie Chan movie in series chronological order on these consecutive days. This is also my first comment of one I\\'ve seen previously though it\\'s been about 24 years since then, so I didn\\'t remember much of it. In this one, the Honolulu detective is investigating an espionage ring that was initially tracked by a former Scotland Yard acquaintance who has turned up missing in the Big Apple...This is the best of the Chan entries I\\'ve seen so far in current memory with every clue being connected (though, of course, if I look at them at closer examination, there could still be some holes though I can\\'t think of any right now). And \"No. 2 Son\" Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) is somewhat of a help when he first identifies the poison that results in some murders early on, though, of course, he blunders a little later. Among the returning supporting cast from the last Chan film-Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum-are blonde Joan Valerie as June Preston and Stanley Blystone, who\\'s brother John G. helmed a lost Chan one called Charlie Chan\\'s Chance, as a fingerprint expert. Nice intrigue especially with an exciting climax aboard a bomber plane. Oh, and watch for a certain Stooge at a police line up...',\n",

Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be the`` nasty duckling'', but the funny thing is that she's not at all ugly( actually she's a multiple more exciting than Uma Thurman, the boyfriend who looks love a model). Now, would this movie work if the`` ugly duckling'' was really unattractive? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy? In my opinion, although the message that it wants to convey, this movie is simply grotesque.\n",

       "'Wow. I observed this movie and \"Up\" on the same day within an hour of each other at different theaters. I saw \"Mr Bug\" first, and was then totally disappointed in \"Up\"\\'s follow-up. What a beautiful and touching film! Movies of the 1930s and 40s to us nowadays can be irking with their melodramatic acting and dialog, but as animation the same melodrama and groaning humor can be wonderful. And the soft \"organic\" lines of 30s drawing AND the music just puts you in a nice comfortable mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters: ladybugs, grasshoppers, bees, snails, stinkbugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, crickets, and more each with all their own cute little (but not overbearing) idiosyncrasies. The interaction with the human world, from nemesis (cigar smokers, high-heel wearers, innocent kick-the-can playing kids) to the kind-hearted, and to the unknown destroyers, is realistic and fascinating. You care for the bugs, AND Dick and Mary. The protagonist Hoppity is not some perfect superman who comes to \"set things right\" but a starry-eyed optimist who leads everyone down the garden path (literally! ), and every time you think it\\'s going to end happily in 1930s style, along comes another roadblock...! I was on the edge of my seat much more than with \"Up.\" I walked out of the movie theater grinning and chuckling: something that hasn\\'t happened in a long long long long time!'"
