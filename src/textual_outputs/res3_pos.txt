I think that the movie was really good. Subject, acting and Nusrat Fateh ALi Khan's music were marvellous. Although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male-dominated culture, he has neglected Phoolan's character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her.

My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Film and alternative cinema (small hall, with uncomfortable seats; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed ) were perfect match.There were many cliches used in the film, but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really amusing. Sound was also brilliant (sometimes back being louder than dialogue).Everything seemed to be in right place. And I loved the way how after-war-time was presented. Real fun!

 My first Fassbinder was a magnificent experiment. Film and alternative cinema( small hall, with embarrassing seats; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed) were perfected match.There were many cliches used in the film, but Fassbinder presented them so wisely that I identified them really amusing. Sound was even brilliant( sometimes backwards being louder than dialogue). Everything seemed to be in right place. And I adore the way how after-war-time was presented. Real amusement!

After watching John preform this one of a kind show, I had to share.....It was really something to watch a grown man portray himself as a child.

Very tightly written, acted, and filmed. Violent, but not too much so. Whoever edited this knew exactly what he wanted to portray. There isn't a wasted scene in this movie. "The Usual Suspects" was superb ensemble acting; this is a collection of outstanding individual performances. I rarely buy movies, but this one is worth owning.

Best Adversarial:
 This is a very dramatic and intriguing cinematic. There are many plots and turns. The story or the director starts problem mark on the dead row or deemed offense commit by black gens. This film is very too concentrated by Arne Glimcher and the fine sounds of James Newton Howard is wondrous. Strong outcome of Sean bacall and Ed Harris. If you liked this one don´ t mme`` TRUE offense`` or`` THE HURRICANE``. My lady and me given 8/10.
