The message of this movie is "personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be the "ugly duckling", but the funny thing is that she's not at all ugly (actually she's a lot more attractive than Uma Thurman, the friend who looks like a model).Now, would this movie work if the "ugly duckling" was really unattractive? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy?In my opinion, despite the message that it wants to convey, this movie is simply ridiculous.

This is a silly spoof of private eye thrillers as a novelist(Michael Cain)is called upon to 'ghostwrite' an autobiography of a colorful, waning Hollywood star(Mickey Rooney). At times silliness becomes obnoxious. This is not Cain at his best. Rooney is way over the top. Notable support from Lizabeth Scott, Lionel Stander and the comely Nadia Cassini. Not easy to watch.

I don't see why everyone loves this film so much. True, it does have good intentions and meaning, but you cannot compensate for such a poor script.

I think that this is a disappointing sequel. I miss a lot of the old characters (King Gator, Anne Marie, etc.), and I don't like it due to the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to do the characters. A lot of personality was lost in Charlie, and the villain Red is not even half as bad as Carface was in the first one.

 It was disgusting and painful. What a waste of a cast! I swear, the audience( 1/2 full) laughed TWICE in 90 minutes. This is not a lie. Do not even rent it. Zeta Jones was just too mean to be believable. Cusack was OK. Just OK. I felt sorry for him( the actor) in case people remember this mess. Roberts was the same as she always is. Charming and sweet, but with no purpose. The`` romance`` with John was completely amazing.

Generation #6: 

Best Adversarial:
 A truly confused incomprehensible mess. Most things in the film look more or less like 1987, but then there are futuristic things just thrown in, like the policeman's ray gun. And that automotive! The director appeared to be in love with colored lights. The only really remarkable performance was the girl who played Valerie, but since there was no cast listing, I do n't know which actress that was. This individual is valued missing. Grade: F
