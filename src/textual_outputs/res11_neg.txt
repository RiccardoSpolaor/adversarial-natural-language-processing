The message of this movie is "personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be the "ugly duckling", but the funny thing is that she's not at all ugly (actually she's a lot more attractive than Uma Thurman, the friend who looks like a model).Now, would this movie work if the "ugly duckling" was really unattractive? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy?In my opinion, despite the message that it wants to convey, this movie is simply ridiculous.

 I do n't viewing why each loves this film so highly. True, it does have best aim and meaning, but you can not compensate for such a needy scenario. Woody Allen is a fantastic filmaker, but I'm afraid this is just a piece of garbage. It's extremely predictable and the theme matter is all too evident. I happen to be a huge Woody Allan vent and love most of his work, but this I can not recomend.

I was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received, but after viewing it I was terribly disappointed. Slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a Todd Solondz type of disturbing family reality sans Todd's brand of humor. The story drags along and each scene is worse than the last. Maybe I missed the point, but if this film is an example of every girl's growing up experience I am glad to be a man.

This movie was definitely not one of Mary-Kate and Ashley's best movies. I really didn't like it, and I was kind of disappointed in that movie.

I think that this is a disappointing sequel. I miss a lot of the old characters (King Gator, Anne Marie, etc.), and I don't like it due to the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to do the characters. A lot of personality was lost in Charlie, and the villain Red is not even half as bad as Carface was in the first one.

Lolita is a rebel and she's going to share to our wide open eyes some little sex stories, between sci-fi and fantasy... Well, this Surrender Cinema production is not very good: very bad acting, horrifying music and a story line without any story and any line. BUT, the sex scenes are pretty well done, lot of lesbian scenes, and Jacqueline Lovell, as beautiful as in The Exotic House Of Wax, offer to us a very good final and very hot strip show.

 This cinematic stinks totaly. The only reason I submitted it a 3 was because the graphics were trucks charming. It's total forget for a plot and the absence of even petty surface character progressed made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings. This is by hugely THE strongest anime that arrives out of Japan. I ca n't thoughts they truly bring their names on this junk. What a crying off selling this aspect for$ 20. If you have n't noticed this do n't disturb. If you have, I penalty you.

Regenerating population... 

ATTACK SUCCESS!!!

Final adversarial sentence:
 I absolutely hated this movie! I was 9 when I saw it. It is the only movie I have ever walked out of in the theater. My mom, dad, and I all looked at each other during the movie and knew we were wasting our time. This movie stole approximately 45 minutes of my life. all about it was ridiculous. The entire premise was too warped. Being 9, I was always easily entertaining. This movie demonstrated that I could n't subject myself to anything and still be captivated.

I could have done with the seven gunslingers just staying away. This sequel should never have been done, the first did it all and better. The plot was a turkey, the acting was turkey, the direction, production, camera work... all turkey. Whoever put out this junk should be tarred and feathered. May they not return again!

A truly muddled incomprehensible mess. Most things in the film look more or less like 1987, but then there are futuristic things just thrown in, like the policeman's ray gun. And that car! The director seemed to be in love with colored lights. The only really notable performance was the girl who played Valerie, but since there was no cast listing, I don't know which actress that was. This one is worth missing. Grade: F
