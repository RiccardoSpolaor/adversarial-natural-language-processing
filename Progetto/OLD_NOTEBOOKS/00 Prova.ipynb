       " 'anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that i love bad movies almost as much as i love great ones, and i can honestly say that i have finally seen one of the all-time legendary bad movies: the almost indescribable mess that is myra breckinridge. an adaptation of gore vidal\\'s best-selling book (he later disowned this film version), the star-studded myra breckinridge is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end. the x-rated movie about sex change operations and hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of it\\'s release. not surprisingly, the film went on to gain a near-legendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema, and i was actually quite excited to finally see for the first time.director michael sarne (who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time), took a lot of flack for the finished film, and, in honesty, it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve. the film is often incoherent, with entire sequences edited together in such a half-hazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible. also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals. this means that there is archival footage of past film stars such as judy garland and shirley temple laced into newly-film scenes of often lewd sexual acts, and the process just doesn\\'t work as intended (this also caused a minor uproar, as actors such as temple and loretta young sued the studio for using their image without permission).perhaps sarne is not the only one to blame, however, as the film\\'s screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief. for instance, this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic rex reed (in his first and last major film role) could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex goddess raquel welch?! the film becomes further hard to follow when welch as myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle (played by legendary film director john huston), seduce a nubile female film student (farrah fawcett), and teach the school\\'s resident bad boy (roger herren) a lesson by raping him with a strap-on dildo. did everyone follow that? and it gets even better (or worse, depending upon your perspective)! i have yet to mention the film\\'s top-billed star: the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteen-thirties, mae west! ms. west was 77 year old when she appeared in this film (she had been retired for 26 years), and apparently she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol as she plays an upscale talent agent who has hunky men (including a young tom selleck) throwing themselves at her. as if this weren\\'t bad enough, the tone-deaf west actually performs two newly-written songs about halfway through the film, and i think that i might have endured permanent brain damage from listening to them! naturally, none of this even closely resembles anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe as \"good,\" but i would give myra breckinridge a 4 out of 10 because it was always morbidly entertaining even when i had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on. also, most of the cast tries really hard. raquel, in particular, appears so hell-bent in turning her poorly-written part into something meaningful that she single-handedly succeeds in making the movie worth watching. if she had only been working with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have finally received some respect form critics.the rest of the cast is also fine. the endearingly over-the-top john huston (who really should have been directing the picture) has some funny moments, rex reed isn\\'t bad for a non-actor, and farrah fawcett is pleasantly fresh-faced and likable. roger herren is also fine, but he never appeared in another movie again after this (i guess he just couldn\\'t live down being the guy who was rapped by raquel welch). and as anyone could guess from the description above, mae west was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie - but that\\'s part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema.',\n",

       " 'when we are young, we all pick out an ideal occupation for ourselves: artist, actor, writer, rocket scientist, etc.. while most of us grow out of our pipe dreams, the main character of american movie, mark, has yet to let go of his(and at a thirty-something age too): to become a wealthy acclaimed director. despite the fact that murphy\\'s law won\\'t leave mark alone and something always seems to go wrong, mark is able to persevere during each deterring incident with an even greater drive to reach his goals. his desire to be a director so controls his character that he sees any person or thing in his life as something to exploit to reach the goal. while i noticed other imdb commenters are lambasting mark\\'s selfishness, i think it\\'s an almost justified sort-of selfishness because for mark, not becoming a famous director is equivalent to death. he talks incessantly about leaving some kind of mark on the world, and he sees filmmaking as a way to do this.unfortunately any viewer of this movie picks up early on the fact that mark has a near-zero chance of ever achieving his dream. is he aware of this? no, not in the slightest, and none of his family or friends want to let him in on the secret(in fact even some of them believe in him). strangely enough though, the disappointing future the viewer feels is sure to occur for mark doesn\\'t impede the ability to find humor in the film. this is a very very funny documentary. most of the laughs come from when mark is filming scenes for \"coven\". there\\'s a scene where an actor has to have his head break a cupboard, and it\\'s just not working. another scene has mark\\'s very old uncle bill saying a few lines to the camera; needless to say, after 20 takes of a lot of headscratching and line-stumbling bill finally decides he\\'s had enough. a lot of humor sadly comes from mark himself. his screenwriting, which he seems to think is worthy of a pulitzer, is laughingly bad: \"it\\'s alright, it\\'s ok, there is something to live for; jesus told me so.\"\"american movie\" is, contrary to what people might think, a documentary that anyone can enjoy(even though my sister, who watched some scenes, seemed to think it was downright bizarre). the fact that chris smith can successfully bring to the screen a film that inspires both sadness from mark\\'s depressing lifestyle to hilarity with scenes with bill(who unfortunately passed away before the film was released) says quite a lot about him. i wonder how the dreamer mark regards this documentary. does he realize that it casts him in a bad light? or that it sets up to show him as a fool in many scenes of the film? or does he see it as something that will be shown prior to his own a&e biography segment? it\\'s an intriguing subject of wonder, and i hope the latter comes true for him some day.i highly recommend this movie: 9/10.',\n",

(can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building? why not - it looks great.) all this \"real-world\" magic - leaping from country to country in seconds, to arrive at some unknown location exactly as, when, and how needed - outdoes special-effect and superhero cartoon improbabilities. and yet, only a clueless pedant would allow \"facts\" interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of the bourne fantasy.',\n",

       " \"when the spirits within was released, all you heard from final fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it didn't seem like final fantasy. this is a different story, for better or worse. the familiar settings, characters, music, story, and over the top action scenes should thrill fans of the original game. the problem is that it just isn't a good movie in its own right.the direction during the fight scenes is often sloppy, switching camera angles ridiculously fast in an attempt to make the action seem more frenetic, but only serving to make the scenes look jumbled and confusing.the cg itself is exceptional, but i can't say it's the best i've ever seen since spirits within had much more detail on the characters, although i must admit that advent children's characters moved much more naturally.the plot is virtually a black hole. it's a giant deus ex machina designed solely to bring sephiroth back for one last fight. old characters reappear, but serve no real purpose other than to please fans. character development is nonexistent and the film does nothing at all to resolve any of the plot threads left hanging after the game's end. but it's packed with neat-looking fight scenes with magic, summons, and limit breaks, which is probably what fans wanted anyway.in the end, advent children is a very flashy, but totally brainless action flick that serves more as a side story for final fantasy vii than a real sequel.by the way, don't think you're hurting my feelings by voting not useful. it just makes me feel superior knowing that fanboys/fangirls resent my objectivity so greatly.\",\n",

       " \"fires on the plain directed by kon ichikawa and written by shohei ooka and natto wada is a world war two movie which is finally not showing the allies fighting the axis powers, but the japanese fighting and struggling for their lives on the philippines. the main characters name is tamura , played by eiji funakoshi, and he is a soldier leaving his regiment because of him being sick. all he has on him is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes. like this, he is trying to make his way to the hospital in order to get a doctor and a cure for his disease. but since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed, he begins a long walk. throughout the whole movie, tamura remains a bit cowardish, but very civil, when the other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for survival tamura is still remaining human and would not degrade. a scene which has influenced me a lot to think positively and different about this war movie is, when tamura comes into a phillipino village which is completely deserted. there, he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church. this makes tamura think and even more scared than he already is. that shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine, but a servant to higher beings and human most importantly. after he turns away from the corpses, two phillipinos (a couple or brother and sister : very close relationship) return to the village in order to get their stash of salt back. the main character of the movie wants to be friendly at first, although he walked up to them with his gun, but shoots the woman once she starts screaming. her brother/boyfriend/husband then runs away in fear and after a moment tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing filipino. he does not hit him. after tamura picks up the bag of salt , something very precious , he drops his gun into a river. this gesture is very important in order to understand kon ichikawa's/shohei ooka's profiling of tamura and the war. comparing this movie to other world war 2 movies, it is not typical at all. of course all movies have suffering heroes, but their heroes are more heroic than tamura. he expresses everything that is human: he is getting manipulated , he is weak , he gets scared , he has hope. this is typical for japanese world war two movies and for japanese society. since world war two is not a discussed theme in japanese society, japanese are likely to put japanese in the second world war in the role of the victim. this victimisation is also very visual in this movie. one of the examples is tamura, another one the piled up bodies of japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one is, when the japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street and the americans are already waiting there for them and shooting all of the japanese soldiers which have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no health equipment or anything alike. in my personal conclusion i have to say that it is worth seeing this film in order to finally see a movie from the other side than usual. it also has no nationalistic propaganda which could've been easily built in. once you have watched the movie fully, you will be able to see the horrors of the second world war to its total extent.\",\n",

(were they just expecting crouse to come in? were they expecting she\\'d write a cheque? was billy in on it? one of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.)and from here the cons are start to roll out. i found the beginning ones -- the little learner ones -- to be the most fun. we\\'re getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is. we see the ending coming, and then we didn\\'t see the second ending coming, and then the real ending i didn\\'t see coming but maybe you did. the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true calling.i\\'m going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here. if the first part of the movie seems stagy, stick with it. after the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going. if you want a fun con movie, then here she is. if you want mamet, go watch \"glengarry glen ross\" again -- james foley did him better.***',\n",

       " \"this has got to be one of australia's best productions. i completely disagree with the comments made by 'raminour101'.this series shows the depth of australian mateship and the lengths they went to to help each other out. episode five 'eddies birthday' is a great example of this and it really captures the australian spirit.the music used throughout the series only emphasised the situation that the men were faced with, their longing for home and their loved ones. the numerous amusing renditions of the road to gundagai captures the spirit of the men and the fact that they never forgot home, and that it was little elements such as the singing of a song that took them home for a short while.as for the comment about it being racist towards japanese people, the only thing to be said is that you can't change what happened. the japanese did treat the australians very poorly in changi and to represent it as otherwise would be very misleading indeed. the comment about the screenplay being in accurate is also false. these six stories that are told in the series are composed from real p.o.w experiences.the actors were superb; the best being in my opinion, matthew newton. his performance as david in the first episode was gut wrenching. from being a city boy, to being another nameless face to his captors. we see him change dramatically in the first episode because of his violent attack in the jungle, and in further episodes we can see how that one event has changed him, he is more aware of what is really going on and is always one of the first to help out the other members of the secret nine.stephen curry also deserves a mention. his performance in 'eddie's birthday' is amazing, going from the larrikin of the group, to being sick, weak and unable to take care of himself. the displays of mateship in this episode touch you on an emotional level and make you proud to be australian.i study wwii at university level and have found this series, if not physically truthful, spiritually truthful, as it captures the true spirit of what it was to be an australian soldier.well done to john doyle for capturing the spirit of changi.\",\n",

       " 'what a strangely wonderful, if sometimes slight and bulky, big-budget fantasy this is. takashi miike had already proved, by the time he got to the great yokhai war, that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crime/yakuza genre (visitor q and andromedia showed this, the former great the latter lesser). but here miike, in his first and only co-screen writing credit no less, proves that he can deliver the goods on a post-modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions, and with it boatload of cgi, creature-effects and make-up, and an epic battle that is more like a \"festival\" than something out of lord of the rings. the comparisons can be made far and wide, to be sure, and the most obvious to jump on would be miyazaki, for the seemingly unique mixture of kids-as-big-heroes, power-hungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source, machinery as the greatest evil, and many bizarrely defined, flamboyantly designed creatures (or yokai of the title). but there can also be comparisons made to star wars, especially to the gungan battle in tpm, and to the whole power-play between good and evil with similar forces. or to anime like samurai 7. or, of course, to henson\\'s films. and through all of these comparisons, and even through the flaws or over-reaching moments, it\\'s miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters. here, ryunosuke kamiki plays tadashi, the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world, but will become the hero in a world going into darkness. the darkness is from an evil sorcerer, who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world, and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures, the yokhai, into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission- to destroy and kill anything in their paths. tadashi gets as pumped up to fight sato the sorcerer as the yokai once sato\\'s main minion and cohort, agi (kill bill\\'s chiaki kuriyama, another great villainies) steals tadashi\\'s little furry companion, a sunekosuri. soon, things come to a head, in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories, but can only be contained, up to a point, by miike and his crew. i would probably recommend the great yokai war for kids, but in the forward note that it\\'s not some watered down fantasy in american circles. this has creatures galore, including a one-eyed umbrella stand, and a walking, talking wall, not to mention a turtle, a fire serpent, and a woman who became cursed by sato. so the variety is on high on that end, and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects- which grows to unfathomable heights when the \"festival\" hits with the yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope. but there\\'s also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark, and sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at miike\\'s disposal (and not just because it\\'s cuteness squared); where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury, who ends up in a tragic battle with tadashi in robot form? yet through all of this, the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of miike\\'s career is here as well, which distinguishes it from its animated, muppet and sci-fi counterparts. there\\'s the bizarre humor as usual, including a song dedicated to akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax, and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes (i loved, for example, the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller, or the anxious turtle-yokai). the biggest danger with miike\\'s access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry, which he flirts with, is overkill on this end. he\\'s got everything down, i\\'m sure, with storyboards, and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions (one of them is when all is said and done, and tadashi and the \\'other\\' human character are in the middle of the tokyo rubble in an overhead shot), but the cgi is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots, and the interplay skirts on being too flamboyant, and some visuals, like the overlay of the yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map, just seem weak and pat. i almost wondered if miike might dip into (bad) spy kids territory, quite frankly.but this liability aside, the great yokai war provides more than a share of excitement, goofy thrills, and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies. it owes a lot to cinema, as well as traditional japanese folklore, but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats. it\\'s not the filmmaker at his very best, but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage. it\\'s got a neat little message, and lots of cool adventure. 7.5/10',\n",

       " 'hundstage is an intentionally ugly and unnerving study of life in a particularly dreary suburb of vienna. it comes from former documentary director ulrich seidl who adopts a very documentary-like approach to the material. however, the film veers away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as \"extremes\" \\x96 some are extremely lonely; some extremely violent; some extremely weird; some extremely devious; some extremely frustrated and misunderstood; and so on. the film combines several near plot less episodes which intertwine from time to time, each following the characters over a couple of days during a sweltering viennese summer. very few viewers will come away from the film feeling entertained \\x96 the intention is to point up the many things that are wrong with people, the many ills that plague our society in general. it is a thought-provoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the whole.a fussy old widower fantasises about his elderly cleaning lady and wants her to perform a striptease for him while wearing his deceased wife\\'s clothes. a nightclub dancer contends with the perpetually jealous and violent behaviour of her boy-racer boyfriend. a couple grieving over their dead daughter can no longer communicate with each other and seek solace by having sex with other people. an abusive man mistreats his woman but she forgives him time and again. a security salesman desperately tries to find the culprit behind some vandalism on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent scapegoat. and a mentally ill woman keeps hitching rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car! the lives of these disparate characters converge over several days during an intense summer heat wave.the despair in the film is palpable. many scenes are characterised by long, awkward silences that are twice as effective as a whole passage of dialogue might be. then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and on-screen events leave you reeling. in particular, a scene during which the security salesman leaves the female hitch-hiker to the mercy of a vengeful guy - to be beaten, raped and humiliated (thankfully all off-screen) for some vandalism she didn\\'t even do - arouses a sour, almost angry taste. in another scene a man has a lit candle wedged in his rear-end and is forced to sing the national anthem at gunpoint, all as part of his punishment for being nasty to his wife. while we might want to cheer that this thug is receiving his come-uppance, we are simultaneously left appalled and unnerved by the nature of his punishment. indeed, such stark contrasts could act as a summary of the whole film - every moment of light-heartedness is counter-balanced with a moment of coldness. every shred of hope is countered with a sense of despair. for every character you could like or feel sympathy for, there is another that encourages nothing but anger and hate. we might want to turn away from hundstage, to dismiss it as an exercise in misery, but it also points up some uncomfortable truths and for that it should be applauded.',\n",

       " '\"la lupa mannara\" aka. \"werewolf woman\" of 1976 is a film with a highly promising title, but, sadly, the film itself is pretty far away from being a must-see for my fellow italian horror buffs. you won\\'t hear me say that rino di silvestri\\'s film is entirely bad - it has its stylish moments, and the first half is actually great fun to watch (though the fun is unintentional). the film also profits from an exceptionally exhibitionist leading actress, annik borel. however, the film, which has no real plot (at least no linear one) often makes no sense at all, and it drags incredibly throughout the mostly superfluous second half.daniella (annik borel) has strange dreams about a dancing around naked in the night before turning into a werewolf woman. since she was a raped as a girl, daniella is afraid of men. then, when her sister (cult siren dagmar lassander) comes to visit with her husband, daniella suddenly feels attracted to the husband and subsequently turns into a werewolf woman herself... or something. the storyline really doesn\\'t make the slightest sense, which makes the film a lot of fun to watch throughout the first half. the leading character daniella is some schizophrenic mixture of frigid hysteric and lusty nymphomaniac, who occasionally turns into a werewolf woman. director di silvestri chose to make up for the plot-holes with a lot of of female nudity, which works fine for me. there are also some pretty well-done gore moments. the film is never even slightly suspenseful or creepy, but it is very entertaining in the beginning. also, there are no attempts to hide that this is a slice of sleaze, the camera often does close-ups on the miss borel\\'s private parts for the simple heck of it. i\\'m not complaining. then, for some reason, di silvestri chose to make the film longer by completely changing the direction in which it was going. while daniella is, at first, a typical werewolf, who cannot help but follow the urges of her curse, this suddenly changes when she meets a guy (howard ross, who was in fernando di leo\\'s \"il boss\" of 1973). suddenly, she goes back to normal again, and the subsequent part of the film does not at all go in hand with the first half. it gets pretty damn boring after a while; all things considered, it probably would have been better for this 99 minute film to be only 70 minutes long. at the end, they even want to make us believe that the absurd story (if one can call it that) is based on true events. \"werewolf woman\" has some redeeming qualities; my fellow italo-horror fans can give it a try. however, if you wanna watch italian horror/exploitation cinema from the 70s, there are hundreds of films that you should see before seeing this one.',\n",

       " 'new york, i love you finally makes it to our shores, but its 10 short stories on love somehow didn\\'t find reason enough to be released over valentine\\'s, probably due to the fact that this year\\'s festival also falls on lunar new year, and with that comes the usual lny blockbuster films from the likes of jackie chan (no, not the spy next door) and local filmmaker jack neo who has traditionally released his latest film over that period to resounding success. so why fix a formula that hasn\\'t been broken?continuing in concept where paris, je t\\'aime had begun in spawning the city of love franchise (shanghai will be next, so says the end of the closing credits here), the buzz here is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme, although someone probably forgot to tell scarlett johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules, and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else (well, it was shot in black and white), but here\\'s hoping that it would make it to the dvd at least.structurally, this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor, which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created. here a little more leeway is given, where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together, and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes, in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers, though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise, though already seen in paris.one of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one, is definitely the creative forces behind the stories, from writers, directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city, coming together for a concept film. and what more the star-studded cast too, with big names amongst the lesser known ones all upping the ante through picture perfect performances, be it for the entire length of the short, or as a support to build upon. you can\\'t deny the initial star-gazing in recognizing the notables, from irrfan khan to natalie portman (who also had writing and directing duties), rachel bilson (looking quite like bardot) to spielberg\\'s blue eye boy shia labeouf, who surprisingly can act, and shows off more in his few minutes here than his entire filmography to date.story wise, like any anthology, you\\'ll find some which will automatically appeal to you, and with others that don\\'t. some are straightforward in nature, while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked. but these 10 stories plus 1 (because randall balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks) somehow lacked the more \"anything goes\" spirit from its predecessor, with stories more rooted in reality, compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film (elijah wood\\'s dalliance with a vampire anyone?), or even less adventurous with its narrative style (christopher doyle\\'s, and tom tykwer\\'s starring natalie portman). here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe, with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experiment.minor quibbles aside, i still enjoyed almost all the shorts here, contrary to what many others have felt about it. the short film format is still very much alive, and having them strung together into a feature under the city of love banner works fine, and left me wondering which other cities are or have been included in its lineup. i am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence here. we surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a singapore, i love you, so here\\'s crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road. otherwise there\\'s always the sawasdee bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules.',\n",

       " '\"the dresser\" is perhaps the most refined of backstage films. the film is brimming with wit and spirit, for the most part provided by the \"energetic\" character of norman (tom courtenay). although his character is clearly gay, and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer (albert finney) that he assists, the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is.the gritty style of peter yates that worked so well in \"bullitt\" is again on display, and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence. this is much appreciated in a story that could so easily have become tedious. in the end, \"the dresser\" will bore many people silly, but it will truly be a delight to those who love british cinema.7.7 out of 10',\n",
       " 'when ritchie first burst on to movie scene his films were hailed as funny, witty, well directed and original. if one could compare the hype he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal loathing his last two outings have created one should consider - has ritchie been found out? is he really that talented? does he really have any genuine original ideas? or is he simply a pretentious and egotistical director who really wants to be fincher, tarantino and leone all rolled into one colossal and disorganised heap? after watching revolver one could be excused for thinking were did it all go wrong? what happened to his great sense of humour? where did he get all these mixed and convoluted ideas from? revolver tries to be clever, philosophical and succinct, it tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, it tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller. ritchie does make a gargantuan effort to fulfil all these many objectives and invests great chunks of a script into existential musings and numerous plot twists. however, in the end all it serves is to construct a severely disjointed, unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film to the audience. its plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although ritchie does at least attempt to give his own spin he should be punished for even trying to pass it off as his own work. so what the audience gets ultimately is a terrible screenplay intertwined with many pretentious oneliners and clumsy setpieces.revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and bland movie that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces like fight club, usual suspects and pulp fiction. it aims high, but inevitably shots blanks aplenty.revolver deserves to be lambasted, it is a truly poor film masquerading as a wannabe masterpiece from a wannabe auteur. however, it falls flat on its farcical face and just fails at everything it wants to be and achieve.',\n",

       " 'between 1937 and 1939, twentieth century-fox made a ton of mr. moto films. however, towards the end of the series, it was obvious that the studio had \"jumped the shark\", so to speak. this phrase indicates that a tv show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula. for example, with \"the brady bunch\" they introduced the annoying \\'cousin oliver\\' and with \"family ties\" they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season! with the moto films, they\\'d jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be re-tooled. in the previous film, warren hymer played an annoying wrestler. and, in this film the character archibald featherstone appears. featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever, as you kept hoping someone (preferably moto) would kill him just to shut him up!! although he\\'s supposed to work for the famed scotland yard, he shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip. again and again, his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and peter lorre just looks pained as he stands there and watches this buffoon \"act\". it\\'s so bad that it truly destroys what could have been one of the better moto films due to its clever plot.as for the plot, the crown of the queen of sheba is discovered in the opening scene. moto, now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was, is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen. in a great twist, several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other.overall, the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that the moto series should have ended here. with wwii approaching, the films couldn\\'t have survived much longer anyway, as having a sympathetic japanese leading character simply wouldn\\'t have been accepted in the us or in allied countries.',\n",

       " \"like a lot of horror fans out there that went looking for the next great scare flick, we plundered the asian horror market for whatever we could get our hands on, leaving no dark haired ghost lady unturned. we had good reason to do so, the asian market had spawned such terrifying wonders as ringu, dark waters, juon - the grudge, and a tale of two sisters. by the time takashi miike started ripping the mick out of the genre with one missed call in 2003, the market seemed to be drying up, leaving it open for mockery and derision, despite the continued hollywood remake machine working full steam ahead. now, don't get me wrong, there were still plenty of good asian horrors being made, the likes of marebito and shutter, to mention but two, will stand as minor genre classics some day. but the lank haired ghost lady had definitely had her feed at the party, and was time to take that success-drunk tramp home to bed! then along comes a film like noroi - the curse. a film that is smart enough to pay subtle homage to it's roots, yet throws the rulebook out the window whilst doing it. what i'm about to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new here at all. the film is a documentary about one of japan's top paranormal investigators as he receives stories and tip offs on ghostly goings on. he starts investigating the claims by a woman that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door, yet there is no baby there, apart from a middle aged woman and her son. these two disappear sharpish when the reporter pokes his nose around, but strange other coincidences start popping up. a psychic young girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a pretty young actress who had a strange vision, a lot of dead pigeons, and a very sinister demon by the name of kagutaba, leading to a truly terrifying showdown in a small historical town...to say any more on the plot might ruin the fun a bit. the film is shot in 'faux documentary' fashion, and incorporates footage from tv shows and news reports, and the labels via subtitles lets you know where you are in terms of the time line. the film has drawn more than a few comparisons to the blair witch project, but apart from the shooting format and the creepy trip through the woods late at night, the comparison ends there really.what is refreshing about noroi is how it doesn't pander to modern horror audiences. if you are expecting croaky ghost ladies to pop out of the attic, look elsewhere. the film's strength lies in it's slow, gradual build up of terror, a terror so profound that it will stick with you for days after watching it. the climax is pretty damned freaky, but just when you think the film is over, you get treated to the 'real' ending when the credits start to roll, and sweet holy f*ck, is it a killer. in terms of acting, it is mostly convincing. you get some 'comedy' relief from the crazy, tin foil covered clairvoyant, but that soon dries up half way through the film. the film also has a slightly 'nastier' feel than a lot of asian ghost horror, as there is a violent streak to some of the events too.overall, noroi is one to watch on your own, late at night. not since my first viewing of ringu ten years ago have i been so delightfully creeped out watching a horror film. it is one that will itch away at you until it is too late, then it is under your skin. just let yourself go to this one completely. and not a lank haired ghost lady in sight?? no wonder it has barely been released outside of japan, let alone had an american remake lined up yet. check this one out if you can, essential viewing in my books!\",\n",

       " '\"like the first touch of pleasure and guilt, like a spontaneous youthful flirt of fascination and fear, like a climax of contrary emotions\" said one of the movie buffs after viewing love at the top, the misinterpreted title version of stylish director michel deville\\'s le mouton enrage. vincent canby in new york times, however, just after the 1974 premiere of the movie stated: \"love at the top which opened yesterday at the 68th street playhouse, is a 1973 french comedy that dimly recalls a number of nineteen-fifties english comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men possessing\\x97and possessed by\\x97ambition.\" yet, the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that love at the top is not concerned with the english class system...(january 27, 1975)having left the evaluations up to single individuals, of course, the test of time has done its just job. what may be said with certainty after more than 30 years is that we can hardly find such movies like le mouton enrage where decadence appears innocent, where liaisons appear youthfully enthusiastic, where feelings occur so manipulative. for romy schneider\\'s fans, it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see, not only because she gives a unique performance (as she did in all of her roles) at the heyday of her career (9 years before her sudden death) but because she is particularly attractive here. it is not trio infernal where the, so to say, \\'forced escape\\' from and the mockery of romy\\'s sweet image haunted for years by saccharine sissi meets its most discouraging manifestation, but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role. she plays roberte, a woman who becomes the object of lust for the story\\'s lead, playboy nicolas mallet (jean louis trintignant). it is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons. this movie can boast truly memorable and unique shots of romy and she is given some of her very best scenes. romy\\'s sex appeal is unforgettable here.another strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception. immoral as it may seem, the director makes a perfect use of contrast: conventions vs pleasures, innocence vs decadence, genuine lust vs instrumental affair. nicola owns most of the features that viewers may like or detest, may find attractive or disgusting; yet, his are the features the viewers must treat seriously, more to say, they are the ones we all must accept. that is why, one is led to a peculiar, gently wild, erotically unique world of the main character. although he sleeps with lots of women, there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for nicola: roberte groult (romy schneider) and marie-paul (jane birkin). he manipulates them, makes love to them, cannot refrain from both desire for their bodies and desire for money; yet, he perceives them differently. yet, despite all of this \\'adult maturity,\\' he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toy-car on the table - a sort of \\'detailed insight into male mind...\\' in a comedy-like way, of course.finally, there are very good performances, which makes le mouton enrage slightly underrated. not only the aforementioned romy schneider does a brilliant job supplying the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role, but young jane birkin appears to be convincing in the role of young, inexperienced streetwalker marie paul, jean louis trintignant makes it possible to see nicola in the right way. this artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by camille saint-saëns, the tune that will ring in your ears for long. therefore, apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors, slow action (sometimes), possible clichés (noticed by some viewers), the merits should be found significant. le mouton enrage, in sum, is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life. it is worth seeing as a moment in romy\\'s career, a prelude to strong eroticism, a chain of contrary emotions, of love and hatred, appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm... but aren\\'t we, humans, \\'viewers,\\' movie buffs built upon such contrasts?',\n",

(carrie also has something about her, looks-wise. not just a run of the mill sexy girl.) but, carrie has an edge -- she might be nice on the eyes, but has a few too many personality traits not too far different than her father.and, she readily admits to it -- for instance, one episode revolves at her lack of desire to be nice to co-workers. i personally find her b*ness sexy, but you have to be the right sort of person to be able to live with that. amiable doug is a good match. and, deep down, see likes the simple things too. maybe, not as much as doug whose nirvana is watching tv and eating a big snack next to his big screen t.v., but no culture gal she. this lack of an overally sensitive side is one reason the two don\\'t have children. of course, the simple pleasures of a guy is nothing to sneer at either, and adds to the charm of the show. they live an ordinary working class sort of life in queens -- it is realistic in that sense. and, overall, amusing and pleasant sitcom fare, esp. if you just want to relax. it gets a little tired at the end, so it\\'s probably good it is ending. it had a good run. see also, becker.',\n",

       " 'this one came out during the western genre’s last gasp; unfortunately, it emerges to be a very minor and altogether unsatisfactory effort – even if made by and with veterans in the field! to begin with, the plot offers nothing remotely new: james coburn escapes from a chain gang, intent on killing the man (now retired) who put him there – charlton heston. while the latter lays a trap for him, coburn outwits heston by kidnapping his daughter (barbara hershey). naturally, the former lawman – accompanied by hershey’s greenhorn fiancé (chris mitchum) – sets out in pursuit of coburn and his followers, all of whom broke jail along with him.rather than handling the proceedings in his customary sub-fordian style, mclaglen goes for a sam peckinpah approach – with which he’s never fully at ease: repellent characters, plenty of violence, and the sexual tension generated by hershey’s presence among coburn’s lusty bunch. incidentally, heston and coburn had previously appeared together in a sam peckinpah western – the troubled major dundee (1965; i really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on dvd, though i recently taped the theatrical version in pan-and-scan format off tcm uk). anyway, the film is too generic to yield the elegiac mood it clearly strives for (suggested also by the title): then again, both stars had already paid a fitting valediction to this most american of genres – will penny (1968) for heston and coburn with pat garrett & billy the kid (1973)! at least, though, heston maintains a modicum of dignity here – his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of half-breed coburn by anticipating what his next move will be; the latter, however, tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax (relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing heston to witness his associates’ gang-rape of hershey). apart from the latter, this lengthy sequence sees heston try to fool coburn with a trick borrowed from his own el cid (1961), the villainous gang is then trapped inside a bushfire ignited by the practiced heston and the violent death of the two ‘obsolete’ protagonists (as was his fashion, heston’s demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice!).the supporting cast includes michael parks as the ineffectual town sheriff, jorge rivero as coburn’s mexican lieutenant, and larry wilcox – of the tv series chips! – as the youngest member of coburn’s gang who’s assigned the task of watching over hershey (while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away!). jerry goldsmith contributes a flavorful but, at the same time, unremarkable score.',\n",

       " 'tart is the worst movie i\\'ve seen this year, and that includes both the affleck/j.lo bomb gigli and the rob zombie borefest house of 1000 corpses. i don\\'t know if that\\'s a fair comparison seeing that tart was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the low-budget 1000 corpses. regardless, all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings: horrible script, horrible acting, horrible direction.*** spoilers *** (although i honestly don\\'t think there\\'s anything to spoil)tart is about a group of super-spoiled private school kids. most of them reside in super-sized apartments along new york\\'s hyper-expensive park avenue, thanks to the finances of their neglectful parents. the film showcases the aimless life of one of the students (cat) as she discards her only true friend (as frivolous a person as she was) in the pursuit of the \"good life\" with the in-crowd. that, of course, leads to sex, drugs, and music that is substantially worse than rock & roll. everything is overly dramaticized in the way that truly bad movies usually are. cat\\'s first sexual experience leads to her being branded a tramp and ostracized by her newly acquired circle of friends; her first encounter with drugs leads to her nearly being dumped down a garbage chute after her cohorts believe her to be dead from an overdose. no heavy-handed messages there, he said sarcastically.that\\'s mainly what the \"seen it before 100 times\" plot entails. other minor, and even less interesting, plot details include one friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from all the others, a wild child who lives life on the edge (and finally falls off of it one night in the east hamptons), an anti-semitic british chick who ends her close friendship with cat the moment she finds out cat has a jewish father, and cat\\'s strained relationship with her single mother who tries unsuccessfully to get cat to appreciate the privileged life she has. the thief turns out to be an irredeemable lowlife. the \"wild child\" is played as a toned down version of one of the hilton sisters. the british girl disappears from the film after the break-up. the mother/daughter relationship is seen as totally inconsequential until the film\\'s final schmaltzy scene, where she and her beleaguered mother have a reconciliation of sorts. *yawn**** end spoilers ***about the cast and crew.... dominique swain came on the scene strong with her role as the underaged seductress in 1997\\'s highly watchable lolita and face/off. her performances were strong enough to land her on quite a few \"ones-to-watch\" lists at the time. she was 17 at the time and i hope that they will not be the best roles of her career. if she takes a few more roles like the one she takes in tart, it very well may be.i\\'ve only seen bijou phillips in one other film (bully) and i swear her performance in that one was nearly identical to the one she gave here. i\\'m not sure if she\\'s incapable of giving varied performances or if it was just a coincidence her roles in the two were so very similar. my guess is that the former is true. i sense this woman possesses very little talent as far as acting is concerned. here, she is the actress tapped to portray the watered-down hilton sister. that she gives such a weak performance is amazing considering that she grew up with, and remains friends with, the real-life hilton sisters. she\\'s essentially playing a version of herself in this film, and doing a damn poor job of it.as for writer/director christina wayne... i know nothing of her other than tart was her first, and only, film project to date. with a first effort like this it is no wonder her career in show business was short-lived.',\n",

       " 'telling the story wouldn\\'t be the point at all, would it? barnens ö, spelled almost like \"booné aww\" is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.children\\'s island is the title, and what an island. in the book, raine, the main character has the guiness world record book as his own bible. and he\\'s keen on breaking new records himself. in particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.the story is, as most swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring. bergman was beginning his final film and cries and whispers was barely out. expectations for any swedish film were pretty high. they taught us then that great theatre, great actors, superb writers and gifted directors made a veritable team of perfection in cinema.all this said, barnens ö is a story of discovery. it is, too, a story of alienation: cities are alienating and living in one of them make us aliens to most of its residents. it is a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our own destiny. it is a film of overwhelming hope and desperation. of feelings buried under layers and layers of isolation and insulation from a world that couldn\\'t care less...this approach, in itself, is a pretty difficult way to weave a convincing narrative. here, the masterful guidance of kay pollak on ola olsson\\'s script of p c jersilds novel, turns it not only in a possibility, but in one of those master pieces of cinema.i may disagree a bit with someone who said that this work was all but forgotten. it is not. even as i write this in 2009, discussions on p c jersild\\'s story are conducted all over the world, and the film shown at many film schools and small theatres.why? waxing philosophical on all of it would be difficult and many have already done it scholarly through writing and lectures. the reason why barnens ö was and is a special story is the cosy feeling you get from the start when you discover that everything is told through the eyes of a small child. and that\\'s where it ends, too. maybe it\\'s a clinical view, as someone else pointed out. but deeply disturbing, moving and satisfying. the concept is deep: as long as we have no pubic hair, we still can live one more day as an angel. afterwards, we\\'ll become what raine reflects as the colophon of his experiences: \"men are pigs\". he finds his fears when he\\'s fearless. he finds love when the world is crumbling around him. he discovers a reason not to behave like the grown-ups because he refrains from committing crimes. he let go his inner purity and confidence in others without reservation, just to learn how rotten the soul of a man can be.where love is expected, he finds hatred. where compassion is needed, he finds suspicion and cold hearts. it\\'s a film of metaphors. a film to think and to raise questions that are hard to ask but harder to answer.in the end, the satisfaction of witnessing such a superb work (that really upped the ante for any other swedish film after) is a ride of joy and hope. be aware that it is a film full with the dark side of our nature. but, alas!, a film of hope and deep joy. reine will still be an island in stockholm, but there is the big hope of living today in full, even when we found our first signs of sexual maturity show.',\n",

       " '\"quai des orfevres\", directed by the brilliant henri-georges clouzot, is a film to treasure because it is one of the best exponents of french film making of the postwar years. m. clouzot, adapting the steeman\\'s novel, \"longtime defence\", shows his genius in the way he sets the story and in the way he interconnects all the characters in this deeply satisfying movie that, as dbdumonteil has pointed out in this forum, it demonstrates how influential cluzot was and how much the next generation of french movie makers are indebted to the master, especially claude chabrol.the crisp black and white cinematography by armand thirard has been magnificently transferred to the criterion dvd we recently watched. working with clouzot, thirard makes the most of the dark tones and the shadows in most of the key scenes. the music by francis lopez, a man who created light music and operettas in france, works well in the context of the film, since the action takes place in the world of the music halls and night clubs.louis jouvet, who is seen as a police detective, is perfect in the part. this was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a pillar of the french theater. jouvet clearly understood well the mechanics for the creation of his police inspector who is wiser and can look deeply into the souls of his suspects and ultimately steals the show from the others. in an unfair comment by someone in this page, jouvet\\'s inspector is compared with peter falk\\'s columbo, the television detective. frankly, and no disrespect to mr. falk intended, it\\'s like comparing a great champagne to a good house wine.bernard blier is perfect as the jealous husband. blier had the kind of face that one could associate with the man consumed with the passion his wife jenny lamour has awakened in him. martineau is vulnerable and doesn\\'t act rationally; he is an easy suspect because he has done everything wrong as he finds in the middle of a crime he didn\\'t commit, but all the evidence points to the contrary.the other great character in the film is dora, the photographer. it\\'s clear by the way she interacts with jenny where her real interest lies. simone renant is tragically appealing as this troubled woman and makes an enormous contribution to the film. suzy delair, playing jenny, is appealing as the singer who suddenly leaps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like brignon, the old lecher.the film is one of the best clouzot directed during his distinguished career and one that will live forever because the way he brought all the elements together.',\n",

       " 'i came out of \"rendition\" with a list of flaws a mile long, so how is it that my overall impression is that it was a pretty decent movie? it\\'s definitely a film whose sum is better than its parts.those parts include a cast of big name stars, not one of them giving a memorable performance (omar metwally, a relative unknown, is the one you\\'ll remember); serviceable if undistinguished direction; and a screenplay that\\'s both too complicated and too simplistic at the same time. metwally is an egyptian-born american citizen who gets kidnapped by the u.s. government\\'s rendition program, otherwise known as the process by which america tortures suspected terrorists into confessing information whether or not it\\'s remotely true. reese witherspoon plays his pregnant wife, who calls in the favor of an old college friend (peter saarsgard), who works for a senator (alan arkin) and helps to track her husband down. meryl streep plays the head of the rendition program; jake gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to the interrogation and whose conscience gets in the way. meanwhile, a whole parallel storyline follows the daughter of a top egyptian official who is allied to the american rendition program and her boyfriend, who\\'s in training to become a suicide bomber.ay-yi-yi that\\'s a lot of plot to pack into a two-hour movie, and i was about to wash my hands of the whole thing, especially the egyptian romeo and juliet subplot that felt like nothing more than a distraction. but then near the film\\'s finale, a twist of chronology brings all of the plot strands together in a way that makes you want to reassess everything you thought you knew about the motivations of the various characters, and makes \"rendition\" a much more interesting movie than it seems like it\\'s going to be.witherspoon, gyllenhaal and sarsgaard all look like high school students playing adults twenty years older than they actually are -- gyllenhaal in particular, usually a fine actor, looks so bored that you wonder if he\\'s going to muster the energy to deliver his lines. and the screenwriter should be arrested for having an actress as good as meryl streep at his disposal and giving her nothing more to work with than this one-dimensional dragon lady. the movie of course strives for relevancy, but instead of addressing the tangled web of arguments surrounding the national security issue, it charges right down the middle of the debate in a predictable fashion. there are moments when you think maybe the film will veer off in an interesting direction -- what if witherspoon did actually begin to doubt her husband\\'s past, for instance? what if metwally actually had been in contact with terrorists, as his interrogators accuse? but no, the movie takes the path of least resistance.but, like i said upfront, i recommend this movie. i know i\\'ve done nothing but list a bunch of its faults, but it\\'s got its head in the right place, and it is entertaining, or at least as as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogation can be.grade: b+',\n",

       " \"not a balanced point of view. the director shouldn't express her opinion as truth. the movie has some criticism of fujimori but it always gives him and his family the last words. so few critics of fujimori were provided that it seems the only reason they were included was to be able to say the movie provides both views. but that is not the case.the movie barely shows one of the massacres that fujimori is accused of. and it gives him credit for the masterminding the murdering of the mrta insurgents that took the japanese embassy. it is well documented that the cia did the planning. there is even pictures of a well known cia strategist on the site published by caretas magazine and other newspapers.the fact that such well known information was not used by the director gives us a few possible conclusions: the director is pro-fujimori and purposely and falsely chooses to give the credit to him; the director does not want viewers to note that the cia and fujimori worked together; or it was just out of ignorance since the director is not peruvian and was not present in peru at the time the events occurred.the explanation provided by other commentators, that fujimori is still fairly popular in peru, does not excuse the lack of accuracy and balanced explanations.also, the statistics provided in the movie for the actual support of fujimori were the highest i have ever heard of. most statistics by major poll agencies are much lower.another point to mention is that the intelligence that was key in the capture of the leader of sendero and discover the secret network was done by a police force led by ketin vidal and he had complete autonomy from fujimori and montesinos.the first government of fujimori did experience an improvement in overall economic trends (gdp) but this improvement was financed by the privatization of several national industries with contracts that were not beneficial for the country in the long term. also, the gap between rich an poor continued to increase during fujimori's regime. in his second term the economy was suffering and there was nothing else to privatize and by the end of fujimori's second term the economy was about to collapse.in terms of investments in infrastructure of fujimori's regime, they fallow the paternalistic pattern. they were created to raise support for fujimori but were not meant to last long. these structures needed continued maintenance but fujimori did not provide political power for the civilians in order to demand further investment. in fact, fujimori's regime was able to destroy most forms of political organizing such as unions and grass-roots groups and the increase in informal unorganized labor was immense.finally, the director chose to spend most of the movie talking to fujimori instead of citing the cases of massive corruption in favour of fujimori (the media, business owners, the military, etc) that were so wide spread it was impossible that fujimori was not aware of it.\",\n",

       " 'karen (sarah michelle gellar), an exchange student in japan who is just beginning to do some social work, is sent to aid an elderly semi-catatonic woman, emma (grace zabriskie), after her previous caretaker, yoko (yoko maki), disappears. karen soon learns that something is not right in emma\\'s home, and she attempts to \"see how deep the rabbit hole goes\".maybe it\\'s a delayed influence from the success of m. night shyamalan\\'s films, but slower-paced, understated horror films are a recent trend. in some cases, such as hide and seek (2005), the approach works remarkably well, and in others, such as white noise (2005), the pacing tends to kill the film. i didn\\'t like the grudge quite as much as hide and seek, but this is still a very good film--it earns a 9 out of 10 from me.the grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend, however. one, it is well known that this is a remake based on the japanese film series that began with ju-on (2000) (in particular, it\\'s extremely close to the first half of ju-on: the grudge, aka ju-on 3, from 2003). two, as with many japanese horror films, the slower pacing here isn\\'t so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism. as is also the case with a large percentage of european horror, the grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare.director takashi shimizu, also the director of the five japanese entries in the ju-on series to date (the fifth is currently in production), and writer stephen susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story. the idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes, with dream logic, where the focus is atmosphere, creepiness, the uncanny, and for many viewers--scares. how well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to, or are used to, this different approach to film-making (although admittedly, some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the ju-on series). traditionally, american audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning \"rules\" for the \"monster\". a more poetic, metaphorical, surreal approach to film isn\\'t yet accepted by the mainstream in the u.s.however, even if you\\'re not used to it, it\\'s worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give the grudge a shot. this is a well written, well directed, well acted film, filled with unusual properties, such as the story interweaving a large number of \"main characters\" (which is done better here than the more episodic ju-on 3), good cinematography, subtle production design touches (check out gellar\\'s clothes, which match the color and texture of the exterior of emma\\'s house, when gellar first approaches), and beautifully effective horror material.even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past, the pacing usually enhances the eeriness, and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained. the supernatural premise of the film is absorbing, and based on interviews on the dvd with shimizu, have prodded me to pay more attention to japanese beliefs and folklore. although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of japanese culture, it\\'s interesting to ponder why so many japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary children.i subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichéd mystery/thriller territory with a \"here\\'s what really happened\" flashback, but even that was fairly well done, and otherwise, this would have been a 10 out of 10.now that i\\'ve said all of the above, let me finish with a mini-rant: it\\'s not that i\\'m anti-remake, but it is ridiculous that u.s. distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption. the original versions of these films should just be playing in u.s. theaters in wide release. there is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white american actors for non-white or foreign actors. yes, the grudge is a fine film, but ultimately, i\\'d rather see something original using this talent, and be treated to the latest foreign horror films--not just japanese, but also indian, spanish, chinese, etc.--at my multiplex. in the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this, it is also more cost-effective to do this, as (1) you can completely avoid production costs, and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit, and (2) you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film dvds in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions.',\n",

       " 'an allegation of aggravated sexual assault along with some other unpleasant peccadilloes, including improper use of a broom, are made against half a dozen or so of the most popular high-school jocks in glen ridge, new jersey, by a \"mildly retarded\" student (heather matarazzo). the investigation and building of the case are handed over to the da\\'s office, where ally sheedy and eric stoltz are put in charge.rumors about the case spread through glen ridge, an upper-middle-class suburb where the jocks are adored by everyone in the community. (one of their fathers is a police lieutenant.) nobody believes matarazzo. \"our boys would never take a slut like that down to the basement, rape her, and subject her to such sexual humiliation.\" the question is whether sheedy and stoltz will ever be able to shape a sufficiently cogent case that they can bring the jocks to trial. matarazzo is not an ideal plaintiff. she\\'s desperate for love and friendship, and that makes it easy for faux friends to mislead her into making false statements. a slimy reporter says, \"you can trust me,\" but it turns out the reporter can\\'t be trusted at all. another student, a very popular girl in school, pulls a linda tripp on matarazzo, pretending to be her bosom buddy but all the while asking her leading questions about the incident -- and taping the results! as a consequence, watching this story unfold is like being on a roller coaster. at first it looks like a good case for sheedy and stoltz. but then, oops, the community organizes against the law. then it looks good again. but then the reporter interferes. then that obstacle is no sooner overcome, than linda tripp pokes her big nose into the investigation and makes public the tapes that seem to indicate matarazzo was lying. (well, actually, she was lying -- but she was lying to her interrogator in order to please her.) then that\\'s overcome, but matarazzo objects to taking the stand because she doesn\\'t want to be characterized as \"retarded.\" eric stoltz is fine in the part of the prosecutor. i say that for the simple reason that he and i lived in pago pago around the same time. (i hope he wasn\\'t the kid i had that altercation with at the bar of the seaside club. if he was, i take back my compliment.) ally sheedy is a strange actress and hard to characterize. she did a marvelous self-restrained job in \"fine art\" but i didn\\'t sense any particular effort being put into this role, which was rather formulaic anyway. i mean, neither she nor stoltz nor anyone else could give a bravura performance in what\\'s essentially a comic book story.the producers and director had the good sense to choose heather matarazzo for the role of victim. the very worst thing they could have done is cast an ethereally lovely, neotenous blond. instead, matarazzo, without being at all ugly, looks rather plain and this ordinary quality is complemented by her grooming and make up. nor have the writers turned her wistful and gentle. she has a temper and is sometimes irritating to listen to, which is all for the good.matarazzo\\'s character is the best drawn in the film. the jocks are stereotypes. pure evil. they think themselves above the law, barge in on some nice girl\\'s party in east orange, trash the place during a party far worse than \"la dolce vita\\'s\" climactic orgy, and leave without explanation or apology. they deserve to get it in the neck -- and they do.i referred to this as a comic book story and that\\'s pretty much what it is. it challenges none of our prejudices. it reaffirms out belief that the world can be divided into good and evil. and we don\\'t have a moment\\'s doubt about who\\'s who. what i\\'m waiting for -- not really, that\\'s just rhetorical -- is a movie almost exactly like this one and a dozen others, but in which the victim is lying in order to get her name and photo in the papers and garner all those sympathy chips from right-thinking folk like the rest of us.the film is based on a true story, as are so many others we\\'ve all seen, and even more fictional features. (eg., \"the accused\".) some are good, some are strictly routine. okay. fair enough. now when do we get to see a film about the tawana brawley case, in which the teen-aged girl disappeared on a whim for a few days, then had her friends strip her, tie her up, and smear her with dirt, so she could claim she\\'d been abducted and raped by the police? now that would be a challenge in a way this one simply is not.',\n",

       " 'as was to be expected, a mazursky film made in the 70s would be counter-culture, sympathetic towards the hippies - and have a lot of hippies in it - and, naturally, it is childishly anti-authoritarian (e.g. the scene on the mexican border, when sutherland provokes a custom\\'s officer by showing little respect and then accuses the latter of making him open his luggage only because he (sutherland) has long hair). the constant left-wing dribble could have gotten on my nerves had i not been prepared for it beforehand; sutherland muses aloud to his family and friends about potential movie ideas for his next film, and most of these ideas are either about blacks or indians (needless to say, he would be welcomed with open arms in today\\'s hollywood). one of his movie ideas is about a black uprising in beverly hills - a race-war, so-to-speak, in the middle of l.a.. this is the kind of nonsense that mazursky thinks about when writing scripts for his movies. fortunately, some of sutherland\\'s hippie friends make fun of this black-revolution premise, and the resulting dialogue isn\\'t bad; a little later, the jewish guy makes a crack about sutherland making a movie about \"masturbation and the black problem\", when the latter starts talking about masturbation. another funny moment is when sutherland\\'s older daughter performs some pc crap on stage with her white school-mates, and they all say: \"we, the black people of the republic of south africa...\".there is always a certain amount of self-indulgence when hollywood makes a movie about hollywood - especially when it\\'s hollywood making a movie about hollywood discussing hollywood doing movies. now, that\\'s very, very self-indulgent, indeed. the scene with fellini (playing himself) is more amusing than annoying, though. mazursky throws in the standard flower-children and anti-vietnam bullshit into the soup, and also pokes fun at corporate hollywood, but he was/is just as much a part of the \"phony hollywood\" (lyrics from that song in the surreal war segment) as anyone else; i am pretty sure that he, too, makes phony small-talk in beverly hills parties and grins fakely while shaking the hands of people whom he either doesn\\'t know or like, but whose money he wants badly for his next (left-wing) project. as for his hair: he has the worst hair i\\'ve seen in a very long time (on film or elsewhere); it\\'s sort of like the kind of long hair that a middle-aged accountant would have if he grew it long. the film remains relatively interesting in spite of its aimlessness, but it bogs down somewhat into tedium in the last third. if you\\'d like to read my parody/biography of donald sutherland (and other hollywood actors), contact me by e-mail.',\n",

       " 'i lay the blame for the comebacks on anyone who enjoyed date movie and epic movie. you people encouraged the fox studio to keep on churning out desperate parody films, and now we\\'re faced with what just may be the laziest and most desperate one of them all. the comebacks barely qualifies as a parody. heck, it barely qualifies as a movie. this is a comedy in theory, but not in execution. no one, not even the people involved with this mess, could have possibly fooled themselves into thinking they were making a funny movie. director tom brady (the hot chick) has made something truly wretched here.the plot, if you can even call it that, centers on a man named lambeau fields (david koechner). right when i heard his name within the first couple seconds of the film, i knew i was in for a long movie. funny names are seldom funny, and become even less funny the more you hear them. lambeau is one of the worst coaches in the world, but he\\'s been given another chance by his best friend, freddie wiseman (carl weathers), to coach a ragtag high school football team called the comebacks. lambeau must not only lead the team to victory, but also teach them the ways of inspirational sports movie clichés. he expects his kids to have poor grades and problems with alcohol, and ridicules them when they don\\'t. when it looks like the team has a chance to play at the big championship toilet bowl game (did 10-year-olds write this script?), lambeau is shocked to discover that freddie is the coach of the big rival team that his team will be playing against. turns out freddie only encouraged lambeau to take the coaching job, because he wanted the comebacks to lose.the comebacks is a movie so forced and pathetic, i almost had a hard time believing what i was watching. spoof movies have recently turned into a game of \"spot the movie reference\", and this continues the tradition. it tries to squeeze in as many references to other sports movies as it can, but it either does absolutely nothing with them, expecting us to just point at the screen and laugh out of familiarity, or it attempts to be funny and falls flat on its face. some of the films referenced include field of dreams, bend it like beckham, rocky balboa, friday night lights, stick it, radio, miracle, remember the titans, gridiron gang, invincible, and dodgeball: a true underdog story. but wait, wasn\\'t dodgeball already a parody of inspirational sports movies? so, in other words, we\\'re watching a parody of a parody of inspirational sports movies. if that makes any sense to you, you\\'re just the audience this movie is looking for. some of these films are referenced in the plot, and some (like the rocky one) are just thrown in for no reason, because the filmmakers wanted to try to reference as many films as possible. there are some that the movie even feels the need to explain to us in its dialogue, just in case we\\'ve missed the obvious reference. you know a movie is in trouble when it has to spell out its own jokes to us.the worst thing is that the screenplay by tv veterans and first time screen writers, ed yeager and joey gutierrez, doesn\\'t even know the first and most important rule of parody - you have to play it straight. the actors have to pretend they\\'re not in on the joke. the reason why the classic zucker brothers movies like airplane, top secret, and the naked gun are remembered so fondly is because they cast serious actors like leslie nielsen (yes, he was a serious actor before he turned to comedy) and robert stack, and then threw them into ridiculous situations. what made it funny is that they acted like they weren\\'t in a comedy, and kept a stone face to the weirdness around them. those films wouldn\\'t have worked if they played their roles broadly. the comebacks proves this, as all the actors are forced to play their roles so goofy, it\\'s like they\\'re screaming at us to laugh. david koechner keeps on flailing his arms, bulging his eyes, and screaming at the top of his lungs to the point he looks like someone who knows he\\'s trapped in a dead-end comedy, and just tries too hard to pretend he\\'s having a good time. the movie also doesn\\'t understand the art of celebrity cameos (also an important factor when it comes to parody films). what kind of cameos do we get in the comebacks? andy dick and dennis rodman.by the time the movie throws in an out of nowhere and extremely pointless cast musical number to journey\\'s \"don\\'t stop believing\" for absolutely no reason whatsoever, i was just about ready to walk out the theater door. i was the only person at my screening, and the thought of this movie going on its pathetic way to a completely empty house kind of appealed to me. i did sit through the rest of the comebacks, and i was not rewarded for my efforts. the sad thing is, fox is not yet done killing the spoof genre. they have a parody of 300 coming out next year called meet the spartans. i\\'d say it can\\'t be much worse than this, but i\\'ve seen the trailer, and i wouldn\\'t want to get your hopes up.',\n",
       " 'let me begin by saying that this remade version of one of the greatest ever created movies \"psycho\" (1960) has been nothing but a fine example of poor direction, poor acting and poor cast. the best way to describe this movie is by comparing it step by step, acting by acting and process by process to the original.alfred hitchcock, one of the greatest movie directors ever lived, had an intention to shoot the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time. okay, people in 1960 may not have been used to bloodshed or horrifying scenes as much as we are today but that didn\\'t prevent people from liking it and getting nominated for 4 oscars. gus van sant had absolutely no reason to release this in color except that the year was 1998. what should have looked realistic in color did not. after the shower scene norman washes his hands it is easily comprehendible that whatever was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax. once he washes off the blood his hand is red in color. about acting, perhaps there couldn\\'t have been a better cast of janet leigh and anthony perkins in the original. perkins suited well for norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger. hitch wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked just fine. in this version, i personally think vince vaughn looked perfect and handsome and strong to play norman\\'s role, unfortunately his acting was nothing less than terrible. in the motel office where norman and marion have the long conversation, he had zero expression on his face and his voice and face never changes throughout. in the original in the same scene when the madhouse is described, we can clearly see the sudden change of expression on perkins\\'s face and he looks scaringly angry although not aggressively. vince vaughn here works out the entire conversation like he\\'s just had his lines by heart. again, terrible acting. same is with anne heche. in the opening scene in the original, we can see how tensed and nervous marion (janet) is when she drives to phoenix. she was happy in getting the money but at the same time scared for life. that\\'s what i call acting. in the remake, heche has no signs of fear and she smiles periodically for getting the money. i don\\'t think anyone would be \"happy and smiling\" when they\\'ve just stolen $400000 and the entire state police is behind them. in the shower scene, janet in the original grips the curtain, turns around and dies after getting stabbed. in the remake, heche gets stabbed, turns around, then sways the other way, has a foolish expression on her face and manages to die with great effort. again, terrible acting.there are also some specially introduced changes in this movie from the original that seems to have nothing to do with the plot line and the ongoing situation. in the scene where arbogast gets murdered, two scenes blink in between the stabs. one with a naked woman and the other with a sheep. many people including myself aren\\'t exactly sure whether the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever it was. what on earth does a beast or a naked woman have to do with an investigator\\'s murder! the changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary. there are a couple of changes in the ending scene as well. let me add some (and the only) positive points along with that. i felt julianne moore did her job well and played a good character of lila. and william macy acted well, that was almost exactly how arbogast\\'s character should have been played.it is common man\\'s knowledge that the purpose and intention of a movie remake is to make the present generation aware of a movie that has a good classic plot line, and to try and make it look better than the original. and if anything has happened here according to what i just said, it is directly the opposite. unfortunately many people like me weren\\'t impressed after watching this movie unless we came to know of the existence of an unforgettable original version. please do not watch this movie, it is nowhere near the original and the original will always remain one of the best ever created movies if not the best.',\n",
       " 'i had only written one review on imdb prior to this, as i consider most games as unworthy of the time and effort...curse of monkey island is different.having played and been impressed by monkey 1 and 2, i had great expectations for the third release...and was not disappointed. the first thing that hit me was the substantially improved graphics. don\\'t get me wrong, for games made in 1990 and 1991 respectively, monkey 1 and 2 were ground-breaking and provided the goods well, but cmi steps up and delivers a superb cartoon-style game-play which is both fun and satisfying. all scenes and settings have been carefully crafted and well thought out, and suit this type of game perfectly. the animation/cgi is a mixture of realism and exaggeration; a fantastic combination in this case. for me the script has been crucial in the success of the previous two games. the cmi script is clever, appropriate and, above all, absolutely hilarious. added to this, the script is now audio unlike the previous two where speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen. dominic armato\\'s voice is perfect for guybrush: witty, clear and slightly naive. all other voice talents fit their characters perfectly, especially earl boen who is the voice behind lechuck. i loved every single character throughout the game: not just their personalities and wit, but the way each character is animated superbly and distinctively. whilst on the subject of audio effects, the soundtrack is worth a mention. the soundtracks for monkey 1 and 2 were both monotone, and despite this were very effective at giving atmosphere and representing a change in mood. cmi\\'s soundtrack is, once again, a step up. each scene is complemented by a catchy, subtle, playful and piratey (if that\\'s a word) tune. with a change in setting or mood, the music also adapts, adding to the entertainment and amusement that the game offers.the whole idea behind monkey island is to solve puzzles and problems in order to progress. this might sound easy, but is actually devilishly tricky in many places. some may be put off by the level of logic and amount of thinking that goes into monkey island, but in reality this makes the game even more entertaining and fun, and also adds to the replay value. the option of \"the curse of monkey island\" or \"the curse of monkey island: mega-monkey\" (which involves trickier and more abundant puzzles) suits players of all abilities and also gives good cause to play the game at least twice. whatever difficulty level you choose, you are guaranteed a different game each time you replay, with numerous speech options and other puzzles to solve that don\\'t affect the outcome of the game, but are just there for fun. the most entertaining section of the game is ship combat, and the sword \"fights\" that follow. these were particularly well thought out and make the game completely worthwhile. add to this a stupendous story that is non-violent and suitable for all ages which will keep you hooked and wanting more until the very end.finally in conclusion, a uniquely special mention must go to the designers of this game. the way each complex puzzle and problem is thought out is simply astonishing. whilst gathering up items and objects during game-play, you can\\'t see how each one is going to help you progress, but with a little thought and perseverance solutions present themselves, and for that the designers of cmi must be highly commended.10/10 for the best game i have ever played (not an exaggeration)',\n",

(btw, most of the seasons aired in the 80s!!) my favorite episodes came from seasons 2, 3 and 4 mostly.to those who disparage hervé villechaize for his heavy french accent and his short stature: grow up and learn something! it\\'s so easy to make fun when you\\'re \"normal\" and \"perfect\". that man made the best of what he was dealt in life, and if you don\\'t like it, that\\'s just tough. have a little compassion. he\\'s been dead 15 years, and how easy it is to cut down someone who can\\'t defend himself. there\\'s just no shame anymore.i love this show. so it looks dated. hate to tell you this, but we didn\\'t have splashy special effects and blu-ray discs. we were lucky to have vcrs. live with it. accept it for what it is, and that\\'s just plain fun. \"escapist tv\" describes it perfectly, and that\\'s what it was for me -- an escape from my rotten real life. and it\\'s still a lot of fun to watch.',\n",

       " 'director vincenzo natali first showed his penchant for character-based sci-fi flicks with his 1997 short film \"elevated\", wherein 3 people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building. his follow-up feature project \"cube\", released later that year, had a very similar premise, this time with 6 people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps. both were admirable attempts to take the sci-fi genre a step further, by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation, choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element, how the characters act, react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions. after his exploration into the mainstream with 2002\\'s \"cypher\", natali has come back to his bizarre character-film trend to bring us \"nothing\", his latest, and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of \"what if?\"dave (david hewlett) and andrew (andrew miller) are life-long friends, brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with. dave, who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature, lives rent-free with andrew at his ill-located and ill-constructed house, where he often takes advantage of andrew\\'s neurotic and antisocial mentality. despite all this, the two misfits are happy together, until one day their deep character flaws, coupled with some astronomically bad luck, land them in the middle of some pretty serious, jail-sentence-worthy trouble. on top of this, they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset, so in the hazy, nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them, they wish that the whole world would just disappear. and it does.going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the film\\'s slow (occasionally too slow) reveal about what\\'s happened to dave and andrew, and how they deal with their new reality. natali\\'s fascination with studying human behavior under duress (ala the birds) is here in spades, but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers, he\\'s able to break away from the thriller-horror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level. it\\'s almost as if he\\'s made the aphoristic opposite of \"cube\".of course, the film is not 85 minutes of laughter and sunshine. in keeping with fundamental realism, our two anti-heroes\\' dynamic often becomes antagonistic, sometimes with rather nasty results. like the \"desert island\" game, the film looks at how even best friends, when left alone together, can fall apart, but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence. in a very twisted, sci-fi way, this is a feel-good flick, with good heart and good intentions.however, there are a few qualms to be had with \"nothing\". while the two lead actors, hewlett and miller, do well with their parts, their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been, considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour. there is some development in the relationship and personalities of dave and andrew, some background is given, but ultimately not enough. a generous viewer will sit through the less-engaging portions of the film to see it through to the end, but cynics will probably give up pretty fast.acting, as mentioned, is adequate, and considering the amount of \\'green-screen\\' work that would\\'ve been needed, reasonably convincing. david hewlett and andrew miller, who both wrote co-wrote the screenplay, have been long-time friends of vincenzo natali: hewlett has in fact featured in every film natali has made. perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction. nonetheless, the story could have been a lot more involving. granted, it is relatively entertaining considering that (no pun intended) nothing really happens, but you get the impression that, in more experienced hands, a lot more could\\'ve been done with this premise.in all fairness, \"nothing\" is an impressive piece of work in many ways. the concept is interesting, the direction is inventive, the script works on a human level and, most of all, it shows a progression in natali\\'s creative mentality. for fans of his work, this will be a delight, and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time. it\\'s just a shame that the director\\'s fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great, fun film it could have been.',\n",

       " 'in the bygone days of the catholic church, a sin-eater was an individual that, through ritual, would take the sins of a dying person upon themselves. often, these people were excommunicate or similar individuals who the church would not absolve, thereby denying them entrance into heaven. the sin-eaters were seen as blasphemous, circumventing the chruch\\'s monopoly on redemption. sex this up a bit with some overt supernatural mojo, let the concept wander where it may, and you have \"the order\", a movie that combines \"stigmata\"\\'s religious anti-authoritarianism, \"the x-files\"\\' paranormal investigation, and \"the thorn birds\"\\' sexual spirituality into an odd melange that sometimes works.alex (heath ledger) is a rogue priest, one of the last members of the order of the carolingians, a semi-heretical order of knowledge-seeking, demon-fighting priests. when alex\\'s mentor is found dead under bizarre circumstances, bishop driscoll (peter weller) sends alex to investigate. tagging along are fellow carolingian thomas (mark addy) and mara (shannyn sossman), who was subject to one of alex\\'s exorcisms a year prior. the three go to rome to investigate and are drawn into a dark underworld of bizarre catholic heresy, ominous prophecies, demonic intrusions, and a man claiming to be the last surviving sin-eater (benno furmann).written and directed by brian helgeland (who worked with the same principals on the scattershot and half-hearted \"a knight\\'s tale\"), the film is an odd one, and difficult to classify. it wants to be several things at once -- supernatural thriller, religious intrigue, dramatic television pilot -- and only sometimes succeeds at any of them. this isn\\'t helped by the slow pace or the fact that most of the actors seem to be sleepwalking through their performances with occasional bursts of brilliance. ledger, in particular, has a particularly stunning scene of despair in an otherwise monochromatic performance. sossman, however, displayed the same disconnected performance that she\\'s given in all of her films (most notably in \"the rules of attraction\").the plot itself meanders back and forth between several different story arcs, leading you to wonder which is the main one with each arc containing its share of red herrings. large gaps of narrative appear to be lost between scenes at times, which can be confusing for many, but this is also one of the film\\'s saving graces. the structure of the film -- coupled by the fact that there is never a truly clear antagonist until the very end of the film -- forces the viewer to analyze and reason in a time when most films are blatantly obvious about everything (the exception to this is historical background on the carolingians and the practice of sin-eating, both of which are explained in dry exposition). even at the beginning of the film, character relationships and history are inferred instead of explained. combine this with the on-location shooting and judicious use of special effects, and you have a very old-world supernatural thriller, with even the opening credits reminiscent of something from the late 70\\'s/early 80\\'s.a brief mention here, as well, for the subtle and organic score by david torn, a combination of minimalist orchestration and lisa gerrard-style exotic vocals. a very nice score that is evocative without being bombastic and exists in a very deceptive simplicity.a confusing plot, a lack of purpose, and sometimes sleepy performances would often damn a movie, but for some reason, \"the order\" remains watchable. many people will be very turned off by the movie for its odd sensibilities, and some may even become angry that they are forced to engage the higher functions of their brain to understand it. still, the film\\'s sheer intangibility will prevent it from being either a critical or commercial success until the dvd, which i\\'m sure will be stocked with copious amounts of deleted scenes. a recommended film only for people who like to think while they watch. 6 out of 10.',\n",

       " '**attention spoilers**first of all, let me say that rob roy is one of the best films of the 90\\'s. it was an amazing achievement for all those involved, especially the acting of liam neeson, jessica lange, john hurt, brian cox, and tim roth. michael canton jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves. but alas...it constantly, and unfairly gets compared to \"braveheart\". these are two entirely different films, probably only similar in the fact that they are both about scots in historical scotland. yet, this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that \"braveheart\" is a better film than \"rob roy\". i like \"braveheart\" a lot, but the idea of comparing it to \"rob roy\" is a little insulting to me. to put quite simply, i love \"braveheart\", but it is a pale shadow to how much i love \"rob roy\". here are my particular reasons...-\"rob roy\" is about real people.let\\'s face it, the william wallace in \"braveheart\" is not a real person. he\\'s a legend, a martyr, a larger than life figurehead. because of this depiction, he is also a perfect person, never doing wrong, and basically showing his scot countrymen to the promised land. when he finally does fail, it is not to his fault. like jesus, he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most. he even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much.the depiction of wallace is very well done and effective. but it really doesn\\'t inspire or intrigue me. i find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection. that is why \"the last temptation of christ\" is a better film than \"king of kings\", and that is also one of the reasons why i think \"rob roy\" is better than \"braveheart\". rob roy may be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. he makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones. now sure, not bearing false claim against the duke of argyll was an act of nobility and courage, but it was also an act of egoism and self centeredness. let us not forget that the kinfolk that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act. but rob did the best he could, and that was all you could ask of him.rob\\'s wife mary, is also a normal, ambigious person. let us start though, with how she looks in this film. sure, she\\'s beautiful, but she doesn\\'t wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show. compare this with the two loves (or one, depending on your point of view) of william wallace in \"braveheart\". now these two ladies are hot, but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time (especially the lay persons). maybe not a fair comparison, but just another example of how rob roy\\'s attempts for accuracy are far more effective.throughout \"rob roy\", mary has to live with her vicious rape by the dastardly carrion, cunningham. she feels compelled to tell rob of her struggle, but doesn\\'t because she knows that rob must seek revenge for her rape. such revenge would surely mean the death of rob, and mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice.the villains in \"rob roy\" are equally as compelling. although the enemies in \"braveheart\" are well written, they are hardly original. robert the bruce, a man both brave and cowardly, is plagued by moral decisions that are all to familar in the fictional realm. should he take his claim as the king of scotland, or should he betray wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name? bruce is the most ambigious character in \"braveheart\", but from brutus in \"julius ceasar\" to fredo in \"the godfather part ii\", these types of characters are hardly original. longshanks, although a compelling villain in his own right, is very one dimensional. he is the epidemy of evil, and his tyrant ways stand in direct contrast to wallace\\'s heroism.\"rob roy\" has three villains that are wonderful in their chicanery. first of all, let\\'s start with marquis of montrose. he is a man who is so obsessed with his self image, that he\\'s willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it. \"see to it that i am not mocked\" are his favorite words to his \"factor\". he is a man obsessed with power, upset that a man of great noble bearing as the duke of argyll can be considered of greater providency then him. he is shamefully self obsessed and insecure. he is an evil aristocrat, but in ways that make him unique.cunningham and callarn are the conspirators in \"rob roy\", and are also roy\\'s direct assailants. callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical. he will do anything to maintain the good will of the marquis, which includes backstabbing and trickery. cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the marquis. he needs a father, little does he know that the marquis is his real father. therefore, when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from callarn, he grabs it without even questioning it. he is very much like the evil of modern man, so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others.many have criticized tim roth\\'s performance in this film as overacting. hogwash i say. it is clear that cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film. in a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for amusement, is cunningham too much of an unbelievable character? we live in a society where people seem to have decreased the value of human life. \"rob roy\" simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decreased value has changed. it is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion. rob roy and mary give us hope that goodness will prevail, but snakes will always exist in our world.another character that i find fascinating is the duke of argyll. he is a true nobleman, and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the marquis. he appreciates the bravery of rob roy and mary, and has a direct vexation for the marquis and his factor. he gives the world hope for the people of power. hopefully, people like the marquis are an exception and not the rule.- the final duel in \"rob roy\" is more exciting then 10 of the battle scenes in \"braveheart\".one thing i get tired of is people telling me that \"braveheart\" is a better film because of the battle scenes. first of all, battle scenes are hardly original. from \"spartacus\" to \"gladiator\", hollywood has had a long tradition of historical european battle scenes. \"braveheart\" has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film, but they suffer from one important problem. these battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom.now, don\\'t get me wrong, duels are hardly original either. in fact, there are probably 10 times as many films with duels as there are with battle scenes. but the context of the duel between cunningham and rob roy is a beauty to behold. it is one of the greatest scenes in film history. let me explain why...first of all, the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly. cunningham is effette and dangerous, rob roy is strong and courageous. cunningham uses a fencing sword while rob uses a broadsword. cunningham fights with quick tricky movements, while roy\\'s fighting style is more obvious.the whole film, from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half, is leading up to this moment. it is powerful stuff, and it is clear that rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world. when rob finally gets the upper hand (literally and figuratively,) it is one of the greatest moments in film history. rob wins because he has more to live for, and his honor is more powerful than 10 cunningham\\'s. the use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene. good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get disemboweled just so he can yell \"freedom!\". but hey, maybe that\\'s just me.- \"rob roy\" is more realistic than \"braveheart\"i don\\'t know that people in the aristocracy or scotsmen talked like the people in \"rob roy\", but i do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns. i feel that many people are bored by \"rob roy\" simply because they can\\'t understand what the characters are saying. if this is the case, then read some shakesphere, or put on the close-captioning. \"rob roy\" is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90\\'s. many of the dialogue in this film is clever, but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it.by contrast, the dialogue in \"braveheart\" is hardly very interesting. of course, what do you expect when the main character is a scotsman played by an australian? this is a legend, and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times. this film takes place several centuries before \"rob roy\", and yet they talk like the people today. thus the reason that many people like it better. audiences today have become increasingly lazy, and they don\\'t want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex. therefore, as with many epic films, they expect to see the villians speak a recognizable english accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far away from our american language. sure, it is clear that the wallace is scotish, but other than sounding like scotty from star trek and a couple of \"aye\"s for acknowledgement, the scots in this film fit into the hollywood tradition of how we believe scots should sound.so, do these descriptions prove that \"rob roy\" is a better film than \"braveheart\"? hardly. but if it proves one thing, it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that \"braveheart\" is a better film than \"rob roy\". to put simply, \"rob roy\" is a film that has themes that are very apropos in today\\'s world. \"braveheart\" is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic. you can make a decision on what you think is better...grade - a score - 9',\n",

       " \"the mind boggles at exactly what about universal soldier merited a sequel. since the real star, dolph lundgren, would not be able to reprise his role from the original, there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write-off. bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler bill goldberg and martial arts expert michael jai white. to their credit, they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement. bill goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film, and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role. for once, his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times, and it does not get irritating. the problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films. and therein lies the problem. you do not go to see a van damme film because you want serious action. you go because you want comedy, however unintentional.unbeknownst to many people, universal soldier was followed by two direct-to-video sequels. i have only seen the first, which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke. matt battaglia was so terrible in the role of luc deveraux that for once in his career, the sight of jean-claude van damme comes as a welcome relief. the film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct-to-video sequels, and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original. after years of investigation and explanation, the unisol project is still going ahead, with some minor modifications. for one, the new unisols are stronger and more damage-resistant than their earlier cousins. for another, all of the unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called seth. in the early parts of the film, seth exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome.being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes, we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut. the unisol project is on the chopping block, which essentially means that seth will be turned off. seth, somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained, decides to mobilise the unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down. his only problem is that every so often, a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown. two individuals possess the code in question. seth kills the first in short order, and those who are familiar with the plot kit that van damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be. the rest of the film revolves around the unisols' attempts to get the code out of van damme without injuring him too badly. a subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film, but it adds about as much to the story as van damme does to the profession of acting.the film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés. when seth transplants his command module into the body of michael jai white, we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over. he goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weakness(es). gee, seth, you mean they will not be our strong points? all kidding aside, the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength. it leaves the action without adequate setup. in the original, we are given a very thorough explanation of the unisols, how they work, and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film. here, the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a unisol is and how they operate. at least in the original, a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice. here, one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform (and presumably his body), getting up every time without stopping for breath.i tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner. if you can see it on the cheap, knock yourself out. this is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of mystery science theatre.\",\n",

       " 'this early warner brothers talkie \"son of the gods\" (1930) deals with the racial intolerance that anglo-saxon americans show towards the chinese. chinese-americans are treated like second-class citizens, and whites hold them in nothing but contempt.prolific scenarist bradley king based her screenplay on rex beach\\'s novel about a young, impressionable chinaman, sam lee (richard barthelmess of \"only angels have wings\"), who experiences racial prejudice first-hand when the girls that his college chums bring along for a party reveal their racist sentiments about sam once they learn about his heritage. sam goes to his father, lee ying (e. alyn warren of \"gone with the wind\"), who is a wealthy chinaman with offices not only in new york city but also in san francisco. sam feels deeply wounded by the racial slurs and he wants to leave new york and go where he cannot be hurt by americans. his patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life and the only solution to racism is tolerance. sam has yet to learn this lesson. he refuses to take any more money from his father and catches a ship to london, england, peeling potatoes while he is on board.during the trip, he encounters a british playwright, bathurst (claude king of \"arrowsmith\"), who needs some help writing a play about the chinese. sam and he strike up a friendship and sam furnishes him with cultural information about asians. while they are relaxing in france, sam meets a beautiful young woman, allana wagner (constance bennett of \"two-faced woman\"), who falls madly in love with him. it seems that allana and her wealthy father are vacationing in the same motel. everybody at the motel knows about sam being a chinaman with the exception of allana. sensitive about his racial heritage, sam holds allana at arm\\'s length until she convinces him that nothing could change her mind about him. they fall madly in love together. allana\\'s father drops the bomb on her when he reveals that sam is a chinaman and all the memories of living in san francisco and dealing with coolies floods allana\\'s mind. she storms into the dining room at the motel and publicly flogs sam with a riding crop in front of a room filled with on-lookers.of course, sam is terribly devastated by this reversal of events. he thought that allana loved him but she didn\\'t. about this time, sam\\'s father lee ying falls tragically ill and ying\\'s secretary of sorts, eileen (mildred van dorn of \"iron man\") sends sam a telegram about ying\\'s illness. predictably, sam rushes home to new york to be at his father\\'s side. since his public humiliation, sam has vowed to show no kindness to anglo-saxon americans; eileen is an irish-catholic and probably one of his few white friends. lee ying dies and sam assumes control of the business and he practices his anti-white racism, until he learns that he was an anglo-saxon foundling that a san francisco cop on the beat gave to lee ying and his wife to bring up. the cop forgot about it until two white busy-bodied social worker types wanted to take sam away from the yings. sam learns this revelation about the same time that allana comes to new york and falls ill. during her illness, she utters his name repeatedly in her sleep and her devoted father goes to see sam and requests that sam visit her in order to help her recover. unbeknownst to allana, sam does visit her and she improves, but she has no memory of his visit, merely a hazy notion. eventually, allana learns the truth about sam not being a chinaman and they marry and live happily ever after.this socially conscientious warner brothers/first national pictures release contends frankly and unflinchingly with the race issue for the first hour or thereabouts before the revelation that sam has no chinese blood running in his veins catches both him as well as the audience by surprise. the reconciliation between allana and sam stretches credibility, despite their self-professed undying love for each other. however, in the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that came before it, they wind up in each other\\'s arms.the capitulation on the race issue with the revelation that sam isn\\'t chinese damages some of the film\\'s moral power. incredibly, \"son of the gods\" is a pre-code film that almost seems prudish; for example, sam is an american, not chinese! constance bennett gives a wonderful performance as a petulant beautify and she holds your attention when she whips sam with her riding crop. claude king is good as bathurst, and e. alyn warren is convincing as lee ying. interestingly, warren made a career out of portraying asian characters. richard barthelmess is flawless as sam; he delivers a highly nuanced performance. despite its age, \"son of the gods\" is a son of a good movie!',\n",

i think not, it wasn\\'t connected to the pc and the message wouldn\\'t play unless he actually answered the phone so there\\'s more bad \"hacking\" science there too.ripley agents arrive at massude\\'s home, take him away & will is given a envelope which turns out to contain a lot of money. will searching for the licence plate of the car that took massude isn\\'t a \"hack\" as you never see him break into the dmv computer. the ripley agents who grab dennis in the airport as he\\'s looking for will have no authority to arrest or detain him. will\\'s mother hadn\\'t \"been stealing chemicals & bio agents\" either. and even if she did they had no right to arrest or detain dennis. patriot act or not.i don\\'t know why will was worried about being arrested for any crime in canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the us.the computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against will, his mother & dennis wasn\\'t sanctioned by a government agency. the phone phreak we see will do is the 1st show of any hacking skill in the movie, we also get a hack into ripley which seemed too easy for such a powerful system.the \"guy\" who ran into annie at the airport & was also watching them in the street was nothing to do with ripley & the laughable notion that ripley could track a cellphone whilst underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips.another reference to the original movie when they mention stephen falken as the designer of the system ripley replaced, the joshua project. we discover that the \"guy\" who ran into annie is falken (not played by the original actor sadly) who faked his own death.we also get to see wopr as \"what\\'s going to help\" them beat ripley and they kept the same voice used back then. falken & wopr are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all (the same explosion should kill will, annie & the russian. it\\'s also unlikely they\\'d create a self-contained computer system that has the ability to nuke or drop chemical weapons on the country it operates out of.the whole \"decontamination\" plot & idea are totally unbelievable. those kinds of orders would have to go through the president or joint chiefs of staff. so yet another laughable & unbelievable idea.the ip hacks against ripley aren\\'t done by will, he just contacts one of his friends who suggests & implements the idea. it\\'s excessively laughable that will would get a login just from increasing ripley\\'s operating temperature. having joshua as a backdoor into ripley (especially after it had been blown to bits) is an incredible cop-out and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done with.there is an awful good where ripley is playing dead code and we see a countdown (saying 17 minutes) then ripley says \"decontamination in 30 minutes\", how crap is that when they can\\'t even keep up with their own timer? ripley\\'s attack mission against philadelphia is halted (far too easily in my opinion) and it decides to attack joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a philly to washington where ripley is stationed. the idea of the nuclear exchange to make ripley realise what she\\'s doing won\\'t work (surely she\\'d already know if she had joshua insider her as he\\'d already learnt this lesson in the original movie?) is yet another nod back to the original movie.their cop-out at having ripley repeat joshua\\'s exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up with.if you want to point fingers for bad & stolen ideas the men to blame are randall badat & rob kerchner. this is an awful movie and is best avoided.',\n",

       " \"okay, okay, maybe not the greatest. i mean, the exorcist and psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but the shining is way up there. it is, however, by far the best stephen king story that has been made into a movie. it's better than the stand, better than pet sematary (if not quite as scary), better than cujo, better than the green mile, better the dolores claiborne, better than stand by me (just barely, though), and yes, it's better than the shawshank redemption (shut up, it's better), i don't care what the imdb top 250 says. i read that, a couple of decades ago, stanley kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie, and from the other room, his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration. finally, she didn't hear any noise for almost two hours, and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something (i tell this with all due respect, of course), she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand, and the book was the shining. and thank god, too, because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever.stephen king can be thanked for the complexity of the story, about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing. jack nicholson can be thanked for his dead-on performance as jack torrance (how many movies has jack been in where he plays a character named jack?), as well as his flawless delivery of several now-famous lines (`heeeeeere's johnny!!'). shelley duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to jack's desires to kill her. stanley kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch, and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls.one of the most significant aspects of this movie, necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect, is the isolation, and it's presents flawlessly. the film starts off with a lengthy scene following jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter. this is soon followed by the same thing following jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel. this time the scene is intermixed with shots of jack, wendy, and danny talking in the car, in which kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of tv, as wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of danny, who says that it's okay because he's already seen it on tv (`see? it's okay, he saw it on the television.').the hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place, and it's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge, echoing rooms and the long hallways. these rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel, but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie, and kubrick's traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three-dimensional feel. early in the film, there is a famous tracking shot that follows danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his big wheel (is that what those are called?), and his relative speed (as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs) gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner. and being a stephen king story, you expect something to jump out at you. i think that the best scene in the halls (as well as one of the scariest in the film) is when danny is playing on the floor, and a ball rolls slowly up to him. he looks up and sees the long empty hallway, and because the ball is something of a child's toy, you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him. anyway, you get the point. the shining is a damn scary movie.besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn't suck, the shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. had jack always been there, like mr. grady told him in the men's room? was he really at that ball in 1921, or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? if he has always been the caretaker, as mr. grady also said, does that mean that it was him that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters, and not mr. grady, after all? it's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied, that's just mediocre filmmaking. for example, the amityville horror, which obviously copied much of the shining as far as its subject matter, did this. but it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of kubrick's movies are). one more thing that we can all thank stanley kubrick for, and we should thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall. that one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.\",\n",

       " 'most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life, ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog. the tim burton batmans had it, as did (in an even more grotesque manner) sin city. with dick tracy producer/director/star warren beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework. like a boisterous homage to 1930s gangster pictures- only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker bonnie and clyde- dick tracy is filled, joyfully, with archetypes and bright, primary colors, where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities. villains like the stooge, shoulders, lips, the brow, mumbles, the blank, pruneface, spud. chester gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles, and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass. the film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously.if, at the time, movies like batman and (underrated) teenage mutant ninja turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comic-book outline, dick tracy is more \\'old-school\\'. it\\'s a story of cops and crooks, or rather a cop, detective tracy as he tries to bust big boy (al pacino, in what is arguably his biggest performance to date, and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style), but with no such luck. there\\'s also a little kid, called simply the kid (charlie korsmo, who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than would\\'ve been imagined), and tracy\\'s love interest in tess. and then there\\'s the nightclub \\'dame\\' (madonna, who probably doesn\\'t give any kind of great acting performance, but maybe that suits the role fine, and she sings excellently when called upon), who wont testify unless tracy admits feelings he doesn\\'t have for her. then there\\'s convoluted dealings with taking tracy down, and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voice.meantime, as if doing an impersonation of a howard hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions, dick tracy adds on the wink-and-nod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes. it\\'s a wonder to look at this world, which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers (i.e. sin city, which can be justifiably compared to beatty\\'s film). we\\'re driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line, or whatever there is of it, in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old. i\\'m almost reminded of the cotton club during these sequences, as story, music, detail, and a few big punches and gun-shots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said, which, actually, isn\\'t more than it needs to. and there\\'s a heap-load of catchy dialog from the script (one of my favorites: \"the enemy of my enemy is... my enemy\", plus any of pacino\\'s references to other figures in quotes).revisiting this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater (and only remembering little bits), dick tracy is a hard-boiled fantasy to the finest degree. it\\'s filled with good cheer for the kids, and with some pretty good action squared away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comic-book movies (i.e. pg-13 fare), and for the adults its throw-back central done with panache and a solid feeling for the unsubtle. even dustin hoffman hams it up, and he barely says an audible word!',\n",
       " 'yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction. now it\\'s a prison again. kind of. well, it\\'s more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so i guess in that way it\\'s like a prison. not really though. when sasha, steven seagal\\'s character, is being admitted into prison, he\\'s standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend, like he\\'s in line for the security check at the airport. then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches, smacking around a couple of security guards.let me tell you something. you assault a corrections officer in a federal prison, they\\'ll shoot you on the spot. ja rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second punch. oh, and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot. in prison. federal prison.you can\\'t dress like that at most high schools in america.speaking of ja rule, i have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth, including ja rule himself, had to have been 50 cent. just before i watched this movie i saw one of those shows on tv about the greatest celebrity feuds ever, and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 cent, who had lived the thug life for real, and ja rule. who had not. every time i saw ja rule on screen the only thing i could picture was 50 cent laughing his ass off. ja rule looks like a rowdy 9-year-old every time he appears on screen.anyway, getting back to the plot. it\\'s funny. sasha is an fbi agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so he can get behind the criminal organization. he\\'s sentenced to five years, and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes. nothing else in the movie matters after that, it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences, most of which aren\\'t even well choreographed.oh, how about this, a helicopter crashes through the roof of \"new alcatraz\" at one point, accidentally freeing all of the inmates. and what do they do? they all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. without so much as a basket. they had a ball, but it doesn\\'t matter. the scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch.so some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in alcatraz\\'s state of the art execution chamber, evidently not for stealing $200 million dollars in gold, but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught.hey, good thinking, people. if you can\\'t get information out of someone, kill them. that\\'s a great way to learn the truth! so some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the $200 million for themselves.oh and the $200 million is in gold bricks. i doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency.there\\'s also the issue of the warden at the prison. he\\'s some tough-talking vato who thinks he\\'s a hardcore chollo from the barrio, which reminds me of a joke. i saw this comedian once talking about people in california who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense. these people go to mexico, the comedian says, and they\\'re like, \"oh my god! people live there? that\\'s like, a total shack!\"the best is when the united states supreme court justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can\\'t carry their guns inside his prison, \"i don\\'t care if she is a united states supreme court justice!\"this woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks he\\'s in charge. ha.and by the way, the supreme court justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is 53. that\\'s a year younger than steven seagal. i just thought that was funny.the only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where ja rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little asian woman. that was the funniest thing i\\'ve seen in a movie in a long, long time.you know, i work for the company that produced this film (which i why i watched it), and i still don\\'t have a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, for that one scene with ja rule getting spanked by that asian woman.so read my review of malena and you will see how strongly i sometimes disagree with professional film critics like roger ebert, but in his review of this movie ebert wrote something that i agreed with as much as anything else he\\'s ever written:\"i imagine the flywheels at the mpaa congratulating each other on a good day\\'s work as they rated \\'half past dead\\' pg-13, after giving the anti-gun movie \\'bowling for columbine\\' an r.\"way to go, guys.',\n",
       " 'fantastic series, one of my few favorites (miami vice and tour of duty are the other two, and this series is right up there with them).these guys aren\\'t into wearing frilly tights - they dress more like woodsmen. everything about this series breathes an aire of realism, artistic license or not.it paints a picture of a europe only slightly out of the grasp of paganism, as most of the villagers still have their local deities, and there are satan worshipping nuns, and magi, witches and sorcerers casting spells.however, what comes to the fore most, is that it\\'s a series of it\\'s time. rather than the version of the fifties, which was a lament against centralized government and the mccarthy era persecutions, this series is thoroughly grounded in the 1980s, thatcherist bleakness, and has a strong environmentalist leaning. robin\\'s protector is a nature worshipper called hern the hunter, who often appears wearing the head of a deer, and is a personification (as is this robin) of the green man, an alternative version of osiris (the egyptian god of vegetation and resurrection - it is interesting to note that in these series, robin in the hood isn\\'t a person, but a concept; when the old one is killed, a new one is summoned telepathically by hern - the person may die, but robin in the hood will live forever, hence the concept of resurrection).the music and score are really outstanding, and performed by the irish formation, clannad. when watching it, i couldn\\'t help but think how _boring_ authentic medieval anglosaxon folk music would have been. :-)all this is beautifully shot in the lush forrests of wales, which pass for the new forrest.the only down side is that in the initial episodes of both series, the actors have to overcome their own skepsis, and convince themselves that this really is a serious work. after that, they get into it and the acting is great! michael praed as the first robin (the second is played by sean connery\\'s son, jason), judi trott makes a beautiful and fragile redheaded marion, phil rose as the portly and really kind-hearted friar tuck, ray winstone as the volatile and lovelorn scarlet, clive mantle as the giant shepard little john, peter llewellyn williams as little john\\'s bumpkin friend and fellow shepard, and mark ryan as the ex-hashashin/assassin nazir - all of them giving great performances. also great are the steady bad guys, nicholas grace as the bug-eyed, scheming sheriff of nottingham, and his aristocratic, bumbling sidekick (and robin\\'s half brother, as it turns out) robert addie as sir guy of gisburne. really cool too is fashion designer richard o\\'brien, as the evil lord owen of clun\\'s (olliver cotton) magician gulnar (he appears near the end of the first series and later in the second).the tithe barn in bradford on avon stood in for the sheriff\\'s castle. (check it out on bradfordonavon.co.uk under \"places of interest\".)so, if you\\'re at all into mythology, the middle ages, romanticism, don\\'t waste your time on xena or hercules - this is the real thing, so go out and watch it!alex',\n",

creepy; grotesque experience, a clunky and heavy handed piece which is infantile beyond words and disgusting beyond expression. to see it is to endure it, to endure it is to survive it and to survive it is an accomplishment all by itself \\x96 if any of the cast; writers; extras; hell, even the guys that worked as runners on the set, aid in producing anything as earth-shatteringly poor as this again, then it\\'ll be either because they\\'ve been sent here by the devil himself to destroy the medium of film or, it\\'ll be because they\\'ve most probably garnered employment on behalf of the friedberg/seltzer mob.my boss\\'s daugther, (which i\\'m pretty sure ought to be titled \"my boss\\' daugther\", grammatically speaking), revolves around its hapless male lead, named tom stansfield (kutcher), and a night in at his boss\\' house as he chases that seemingly elusive \\'goal\\' that is his young, blonde daughter lisa taylor (reid) - someone whom works within the same department as he does in a towering chicago office block whilst under the strict eye of jack taylor (stamp). tom spies lisa early on, she\\'s taking the subway to work with all the other shmos despite the fact she owns a car and that her father is the boss of the damn company. after trying to talk to her, but having his attempts foiled by a puking baby and a dog for the blind more interested in tom\\'s crotch than anything else, he finally gets his chance in the office when talk of an after-dark party elsewhere arises and that he ought to come round to her house to visit her - and yes, she does still live with her father. think hitchcock\\'s 1960 film psycho with the gender roles between norman bates and his mother reversed and then played for laughs.the distinct establishment of character is made painfully apparent in the opening scene in which tom sits on the subway train and travels to work with his yuppie cohorts. they are a ruthless and smarmy bunch, whom it\\'s made apparent swipe the briefcases of those unfortunate enough to get them stuck in the door in the ensuing morning rush, without ever returning them. one day it happens with tom there, and his wish is to return it, thus pounding into us that he\\'s-not-like-other-guys(!) this, as he first sees lisa down the carriage and is somewhat shy to approach her as the other men treat the whole situation as if it would be a breeze if they were in his position. this rather obvious and flat-footed attempt to try and get us to \\'side\\' with tom sits uneasily with what it supposedly takes to earn a place amidst these co-workers in this company.it is, however, as close as my boss\\'s daughter comes to any level of film-making. from a seemingly harmless premise of a boy meeting a girl and wanting to get to know her arrives the comedy from hell. tom\\'s arriving at the house will not see him invited to the party, instead he is charged with house sitting jack\\'s pet owl and generally keeping out of mischief whilst maintaining a spotless house. it\\'s been established terrance stamp\\'s character means business in the strictest of manners, firing people for the smallest of things such as the making of a bad cup of coffee. it\\'s not that jack is a shrewed businessman, he\\'s a cleanliness freak; obsessed with control and a borderline sociopath in his placings of bear traps in the garden so as to keep the children next door off his land. you can imagine, that when we\\'re let into his large and exquisite house with the orders that nothing should go wrong, there\\'s obviously going to be trouble.the film has fun with this premise of danger for about ten minutes. the first time someone uses the worktop to crack open a beer thus marking the pristine top, you may smirk, but by the time half the house is wrecked and michael madsen has shown up urinating all over the rug, you\\'ve got your head in your hands. each joke in the film is set up in an almighty clunky manner before it is played out in a way that is closer to slow and excruciating than slick and faultless, the only thing missing as it follows through to the next gag is the sound effect of someone incorrectly changing the gears to a car as it clunks and creaks onto the next pratfall. inbetween the gross-out wackiness, the film takes time to roll down a route of yucky, saccharine driven romance as lisa and tom bond whilst talking of in-workplace and out-of workplace persona\\'s, and that maybe they have more in common than first thought. by the hour mark, the film\\'s opted for gross out gags and hate filled jibes more than anything when there\\'s an entire scene that exists purely to target paraplegics and a dumb subplot to do with a head-injury sporting neighbour on a blind date in which some truly unwatchable sight gags are unfolded. throughout, stamp\\'s character enjoys putting people down and asking if the simplest of tasks are too difficult for them, to which the common-place reply ought to be whilst channeling jack taylor: was reading the screenplay first too complicated-a concept for you, stamp?',\n",

       " 'with the rising popularity of the now iconic godzilla series, like with any hit cinema event, there was inevitably going to be a crowd of imitators trying to cash in on the success on the big lizard. with godzilla came the dawn of a rising popularity of the kaiju (giant monster) genre. many sought after success; a few gained it. one of the few that not only profited, but garnered popularity was gamera, a giant turtle that could breathe fire in and out and fly by spewing flames from the sockets in his carapace as a means of jet propulsion. but unlike godzilla, gamera was marketed as a friend to all children, later fighting other monsters to save kids in peril, and thus gamera became very popular amongst the kiddies. unfortunately, that\\'s about the only audience mainstream that the original gamera series will have any appeal to. while the new gamera movies directed by shusuke kaneko are marvelous, revolutionary monster movies, the original series, including the original, is nothing special.the first gamera movie, titled in japan as \"the giant monster gamera\" was clearly a godzilla want-to-be. even though the movie was produced in the era of color films, it was shot in black-and-white. why? to imitate the first godzilla movie from the 1950s. gamera also attacks tokyo. because godzilla attacked tokyo in the first movie. i don\\'t know much about the japanese version, for the version i am familiar with the americanized version, where scenes were cut and new footage with american actors were inserted (is it coincidence that the same thing happened with the first godzilla film?) now whether this adds or takes away from the film, i cannot say. but \"gammera the invincible\" is really nothing more than a ponderous bore that just plods along like the big turtle himself.\"gammera the invincible\" is a very routine-orientated movie. the characters are from a stock of science-fiction standards, the story is inane, the monster has no real motive for attacking civilization, the acting is laughable, and so on and so forth. the only thing that differentiates it from the godzilla series is the ending of the movie, but that\\'s also a detractor since the plan that eventually halts gamera\\'s rampage is completely phony and ridiculous. now the rest of the movie and many other entries in this genre also fit that description, but this is a direfully stodgy monster movie.and although shusuke kaneko would later transform gamera into an interesting monster with his trilogy in the 1990s, in the original series, gamera was not an attractive screen presence. he was neither scary nor sympathetic. he just waddles around like a toddler, swaying with each step, and knocks miniature sets over. as usual, everybody wants to destroy gamera except for a little kid (yoshio uchida who was lazily left out of the credits though he plays a \\'central\\' role) who thinks gamera is a nice turtle.most movies in the genre that \"gammera the invincible\" is a part of are easy targets for criticism and this one is subject to extra pressure. even in the company of many other godzilla-imitators, this gamera film is not a particularly good entry. and as far as my cinema experience goes, the rest of the movies in the series are either just as boring or worse. like godzilla, gamera would be filmed in color and go on to fight monsters. and like godzilla, he\\'d get cheaper and cheaper with every film until it was time to revive the series and make him serious again.it\\'s peculiar. usually i recommend people to stick with the originals and pass on the remakes. but in the case of gamera, my verdict is just the opposite. i strongly encourage people to watch the 1990s gamera trilogy directed by shusuke kaneko and to skip over the original series unless interested. the new films are inventive, well-made, exciting, and above all, fun. the original series is a long stream of boredom.',\n",

       " \"it would be unwise to judge that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other. both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives. as both formats usually leaves some issues undiscussed due to 'complexities of subplots' and screen time, it denies viewers the opportunity to open up debates and to further investigate and construct the real truth. adding to the viewer's inability to evaluate sources (eg comparisons with written history) and the logics behind arguments, history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentary.to most people, documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually involves actual participants' testimonies and real-life footages. however, these visuals are selected and edited, to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the viewers. in the real buddy holly story, paul mccartney seeks to establish the buddy holly as remembered by family and friends and how buddy had influence the rest of the music world. the testimonies may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of buddy. the documentary did make corrections to the film version and cover other events, such as there were 3 members of crickets and that buddy's music was actually heard outside of usa at that time (he had to embark on a world tour!). however, it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to buddy's wife after his death. criticism and/or negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a buddy that the world should have remembered. eventually, we don't manage to construct the whole truth as we only restrict ourselves to the past 'realties' that the documentary tells us.personally, i prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual imageries, which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that era. it gives the audiences a more constructive structure of the story, and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when they retell the story. there is also an element of flexibility which allows film-makers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues. in the buddy holly story, racial issues were highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situations.movie-goers consistently seek to revisit certain emotions when watching a film, and using these emotions, audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a film-maker wants to deliver. in most stories, people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles, the inspirations and the way the story ends. through the buddy holly story, we do remember the struggles buddy and the crickets had, how maria had been a source of encouragement, and that buddy holly was a great performer until the day he dies.\",\n",

       " 'this is an \"anthology\" horror film. it\\'s made up of 4 short stories taken from the fiction of robert bloch (who wrote for weird tales and was personal friends with h.p. lovecraft, but is most famous for the original story \"psycho\"). the quality of the stories is very uneven and i didn\\'t think very much about the film was creepy or horrific at all. it would have been better to do it as a comedy like \"comedy of terrors.\" only the last of the 4 stories was really done in a humorous way, and it\\'s probably the best of them (the one with ingrid pitt). i\\'ve seen a few of these amicus anthology films and the only one that was really worth my time was freddie francis\\' \"tales from the crypt.\" the anthology style works well for the producers, because it means that they can hire a bunch of \"big name\" actors, employ them for only one week of shooting or so, and then bring in the next big name. so you essentially pay for 6 weeks of movie star salary but get 5 or 6 different names on the marquee. but that\\'s very unfortunate for the audience, because the audience would like to see some scenes with peter cushing, christopher lee, and ingrid pitt actually acting together. instead they\\'re stuck in these vignettes by themselves. so let\\'s take them one at a time, briefly.the first story has denholm elliot, who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer terrorized by his own character. unfortunately the actor who plays dominic, the source of the horror, tom adams, just looks silly which ruins any possible horror. there\\'s some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though, like the scene where dominic kills elliot\\'s psychiatrist. it\\'s the patented scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching, so the whole audience is supposed to shout out \"look out behind you!\" the second story is the one with peter cushing. god i love that man so much. too bad so many of his films, like this one, pretty much stink. in the story he\\'s supposed to be pining away for a long-lost love, and he sees her likeness in a wax museum. it\\'s a completely predictable story that goes nowhere.then you have the bit with christopher lee, where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch. again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs. but instead we\\'re supposed to be horrified when lee slaps the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil. the actress, chloe franks, was pretty good in that type of \"bad seed\" role though.the last story is kind of amusing... ingrid pitt plays an actress and jon pertwee plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire. that\\'s about all the story has to offer. i was surprised at how bad ingrid pitt\\'s english is, i guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films i\\'ve seen her in.not a very memorable film or one that i would recommend to anyone but horror completists.',\n",

(you kids today with your hula-hoops and your mini-skirts and your pat boone\\x85) after bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there (a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric), they find the \"rave\" deserted.passing mention is made of a \"house\" \\x96 presumably the titular house of the dead \\x96 but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence.a fallen video camera acts as flashback filler, showing the island in the throes of a \\x96 party?! is that it? oh, so this \"rave\" thingy is just a \"party\"? in the grand tradition of re-euphemizing \"used cars\" as \"pre-owned\", or \"shell shock\" as \"post-traumatic stress disorder\", the word \"party\" is now too square for you drug-addled, silicone-implanted, metrosexual jagoffs? it is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies. intelligent thought stops here\\x85i don\\'t think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie re-animation. zombies can\\'t die \\x96 they\\'re already un-dead. they do not bleed, they know no pain. unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue being animated. at least, that\\'s what my jamaican witch priestess tells me.which means that a .45 shot into their \"hearts\" is not going to stop them, nor will a machete to the torso. and a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly not bring forth gouts of blood. at least in the video game\\'s logic, the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated, leaving a fetid mush that cannot re-animate itself.yet each actor-slash-model gets their matrix-circular-camera moment, slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum. seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the stormtroopers from \"return of the jedi\", who get knocked out when ewoks trip them.i suppose the film\\'s writer, mark altman, having penned the not-too-shabby \"free enterprise\", felt compelled to insert a captain kirk reference, in the character of jurgen prochnow, who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung-swill. there is also a reference to prochnow\\'s primo role in the magnificent \"das boot\", when one of the untrained b-actors mentions that he \"looks like a u-boat captain\". \". i wonder how many of this movie\\'s target audience of square-eyed swine picked up on any of the snide references to other films, as when prochnow declares, \"say hello to my little friend\", presaging his machine gun moment. aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the sisyphean futility of the video-game concept (i.e. the game ends when you die \\x96 you cannot win), this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart. accordingly, everyone dies in due course, except for a heterosexual pair of attractive white people.a better use for this film\\'s scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through acting school, although ona grauer\\'s left breast did a good job, as did her right breast \\x96 and those slomo running scenes: priceless! i especially liked the final scene with ona trying to act like she\\'s been stabbed, but looking like she\\'s just eaten ice cream too fast.attempting to do something more constructive with my time, i pulled out my digitally-restored, 35th anniversary, special edition, widescreen anamorphic dvd of \"manos: the hands of fate.\" ah, yes! \\x96 the drugs were suitably brain-numbing - now here was some quality film-making\\x85(movie maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)',\n",

       " 'my take: a tired formula christmas comedy. the laughs are tired and the talents behind it seem to be too.i love the holidays as much as the next guy (even if i often have a bad case of the holiday blues), but it seems it\\'s just being a dumping ground for a bunch of holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year, but that doesn\\'t make them any less painful during the season. as if we already had enough santa clause movies (three and *gulp* still counting), who wants to see a movie about his brother? in a plot that would be at home with disney\\'s santa clause franchise (save the occasionally crude humor and santa\\'s \"little\" helper wearing a short skirt), fred claus is a one-joke premise that goes on for 116 minutes. sure, jolly ol\\' saint nick has a brother, but where does it go from there? it\\'s a shame really. fred claus is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow, but it would have been so much better than this. vince vaughn is your typical snob, but we are led to believe he\\'s really the long lost brother of the never-aging santa (paul giamatti), who invites his good ol\\' brother to visit. mrs. claus (miranda richardson) is reluctant, and worse, an efficiency expert (kevin spacey) has come to keep a watchful eye on father christmas, and his this close to being shut down. hah! and guess who plays santa\\'s mother! kathy bates of course. elizabeth banks is santa\\'s helper charlene, john michael higgins is one of the elves, and rachel wiesz plays fred\\'s girlfriend! si don\\'t know if i\\'d praise the casting or to bash it. here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they\\'re given way too little to work with.as for humor, the best that fred claus could possibly come up with is santa\\'s brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a dj elf. i have to admit i had a few giggles involving fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers (where he is joined by stephen baldwin, roger clinton and frank stallone), but the giggles begin and end there. worse still, the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that\\'s supposed to make us \"feel good\" and teach us a lesson about \"what christmas really means\". apparently, what christmas means to hollywood is getting as much of our leftover christmas shopping money as they can.rating: ** out of 5.',\n",

       " 'chris smith is a superior filmmaker with the seldom-seen talent for spotting a good story, then getting the hell out of its way. smith\\'s \"american movie\" is the true-to-life record of filmmaker wannabe mark borchardt, a loser intent on milking his elderly uncle for cash to complete his horror short. but never, under any circumstances, to pursue gainful employment or support the children he\\'s conceived.such is producer smith\\'s skill that mark appears more sympathetic than otherwise. even as he entices uncle bill with sugar-spun dreams and executive producer credits, it is his desperation to be somebody, to have his name coupled with the likes of scorsese and spielberg that touches us.\"american movie\" also belongs in that rare, often attempted but seldom achieved sub genre that successfully blends hilarity with horror. the humor comes from borchardt\\'s ed wood-style belief in his own genius. from his appalling attempts at acting, from his substituting his less than film-savvy mother for a missing cameraman and from his employing sweet but brain-damaged friend mike whenever he\\'s short an actor or crew member.the horror comes from seeing what borchardt cannot: it is this very american attitude--i want, therefore i am entitled--that keeps him from seeing just how much he has to learn about his chosen craft. he is so confident he can\\'t fail that failure is guaranteed.',\n",
       " 'a town in japan is being taken over by a horribly brutal abstract shape: the spiral. it\\'s becoming a theme in everything from animals to clouds to people and twisting them, mentally and literally. this film shows it happening to several groups of people. some demonic possession is implied, but nothing is entirely sure except that the best bet is to get the heck out of dodge. the film progresses really well from normal life to abnormal phenomena (giant snails and crazy people) to the truly supernatural (walking dead).as a jaded american horror movie fan, this was just what i needed. maybe it was just the novelty of a different culture\\'s film, but it seemed to have a very original progression, set of characters, and the premise was definitely new. the japanese may think \"horror shapes\" (uzumaki means \"spiral,\" i\\'m told) are old by now, but it was nice for me because i\\'m used to monster/alien/virus/disaster/undead films. in an american movie, you know who\\'s going to die (the annoying/nasty/lascivious/racist characters) and who will live (the children/heroine/dogs/cats/nice guy). that\\'s not true in japanese horror. it was not predictable how they would fight the evil or how it would end up. also, it had this really new (but probably typically japanese) color leached pacific northwest style cloudy day thing going, which was a fresh visual effect for me. the horrific moments were seriously creepy, relying on a little gore but mainly just impossibly overdone facial expressions (think the ring) and body manipulations. this should be one of the greats, up there with once-original ideas like the first nightmare on elm street or night of the living dead.',\n",
       " \"in a time when the constitution and principals the united states were founded on are trampled underfoot by an administration desperate to distract attention from its own internal problems, where the geneva convention, human rights and foreign sovereignty are unapologetically discarded, a thriller about the state taking illegal action that far exceeds that of the terrorists they are countering might seem appropriate. however, if you want to see a film about that, try ed zwick's flawed the siege instead, because nada is one of the most infantile 'political' thrillers ever made. like robert altman's pret-a-porter, the director has taken on a subject he seems completely ignorant of, and imprints his ignorance on almost every frame.his terrorists are a wildly unconvincing group of stereotypes - fabio testi dresses as if he were auditioning for mad magazine's 'spy vs. spy' strip, michel duchaussoy behaves like an absurd kids in the hall send up of the sociology professor from hell, mariangela melato a cardboard middle-class revolutionary wannabe - who behave at every unconvincing plot turn as if they want to be caught. the corrupt authorities fare a little better, but are still painted in unconvincingly broad strokes.it is possible to make a smart film about dumb people (cf election), but this is a moronic film about dumb people made by people who think they're intellectuals who are talking down to the masses. in truth, were one to recast testi, duchaussoy and melato with jim varney, johnny knoxville and shannon tweed, the result would actually be to raise the intellectual content of the film, not lower it.chabrol might just have got away with his characters and events if he took them seriously, but his staging is so inept (the fight scenes would embarrass a kindergarten class while the shooting of the kidnapping is more inept than the kidnapping itself) and his inability to get his cast to perform with at least some approximation of recognisable human behaviour so blatant that it is actually embarrassing to watch (special mention must be made here of duchaussoy: so very good in chabrol's que la bete muere, he is stunningly bad here in a performance that is so far over the top it's back again).chabrol has made some fine films, but you would never guess it from this amateurish mess - a newcomer to his work would never want to see another of his films after this, which would be a great shame. utter drivel, and a sad waste of a potentially interesting material. one star out of ten - and that's being very generous.\",\n",
       " '******warning: may contain spoilers**************so who are these \"mystery men?\" simply put, the mystery men are a group of sub-heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities. the shoveller (bill macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique shovel-fighting style. the blue raja (hank azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night, if his mom isn\\'t keeping him busy with the latest snooping. mr. furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay, then takes out his frustration on his friends at night, tossing ill-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone to wonder, so what?). ben stiller breathes such life into this character, you can\\'t help but love him.these three spend their nights trying to capture that \\'moment of glory\\' they\\'ve dreamed about... becoming real super heroes. obviously, it could happen. champion city has captain amazing, after all... a flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two. greg kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his career.to bring back that \\'extra magic\\' that might win the endorsements again, c.a. frees casanova frankenstein, a waaaaay over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by goeffrey rush. this lunatic genius has created a \\'psychofrakulator\\' to warp champion city into a reflection of his own insanities... and ends up capturing c.a. within hours of his release from prison. this leaves only the mystery men to stop frankenstein\\'s evil plan, but with such henchmen as the disco boys protecting frankenstein, the trio are going to need a little help.recruiting commences, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with the bowler (janeane garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father; the invisible boy (kel mitchell), who claims to turn invisible when absolutely no one is looking at him; the spleen (paul reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much underused sphinx (wes studi), who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise.this film really is a cross-genre romp. anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle. this is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-burton sets recycled endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up. but at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well. both at once. while not a necessarily unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflective of d.c. comic\\'s short-lived inferior five work), it is fairly innovative for the big screen. it offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if superheroes were real, so would these guys be real. if the big guy with the s were flying around new york city, you\\'d see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis. sure, the shoveller fights pretty well, and the blue raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world. but does that make them genuine super-heroes? only in their minds.this movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. inevitable, when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics. one-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. particularly marvelous is the dialogue by janeane garofalo with her bowling ball/father. yet, it isn\\'t a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes. it mixes in a dose of drama, of discovery and of romance, but never really ventures fully into any of it.what really makes mystery men a good film, in the end, is that it is very engaging. the weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and, for one shining moment, really become super-heroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). if the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great romp.of course, no movie is perfect. claire forlani comes off as bored and directionless as mr. furious\\' love interest, in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience. tom waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor dr. heller, although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone. and the villians are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point of which is made in the film). the cinematography is choppy and disjointed (such as happens in the average comic book, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well.yet, overall, this film is incredible. you probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it\\'s a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest.8/10 in my opinion.',\n",

       " 'i should admit first i am a huge fan of the dandy warhols, and that is the reason i came watching this film.the uniqueness of this film, compared to other modern rockumentaries, is that it\\'s not just about one page of a band\\'s history (like \"i am trying to break your heart\", about wilco), but rather covers long period of the band\\'s history. in this movie, director/producer ondi timoner closely followed friends/rivals the brian jonestown massacre (bjm) and the dandy warhols (dw) for more than 8 years (1995 - 2003) and shoot tremendous 1500 hours of raw video, cut than to 1:45 hours (the future dvd release will contain much more material than the original film). the result is astonishing - there are no fillers - the film is 100% pure and genuine archive footage, which gives you feeling as film progresses that you live with the bands, through all these years.both bands in the start of their careers promised to \"make a revolution\" in the music making, and not to sell their souls to the devil of \"record industry\". however, their paths quickly diverged - the dandy warhols signed a contract with capitol records and became relatively popular (especially in europe) after only one album, while the brian jonestown massacre (with its self-destruction-bound leader anton newcombe) dissolved into oblivion (at least how it is portrayed in the film). and the movie follows the descent of the brian jonestown massacre, contrasted by the ascent of the dandy warhols.first, i was delighted by the movie and its approach of telling the story of anton newcombe (for example, courtney taylor - the leader of the dandy warhols - narrates), but after some thinking i realized that something is wrong with this film.first, it treats anton newcombe as a disappeared person. the project started in 1995 as a documentary about several promising emerging groups, in which anton newcombe and ondi timoner were equal partners (that was the reason why all these years ondi timoner had unmediated access to the both bands). it was anton newcombe who brought the dandy warhols into the project. in the end he was ignored completely, as if he was kicked out of the project. everybody talk about bjm, but he does not take part in the discussion. i guess he wasn\\'t even informed when the group started the final editing process. there are always both sides of the story, and here we have only one... of course, as one would expect, anton does not approve the final result and sees this movie as a betrayal of his former friends.second, the film is very dandy warhols-biased. sure, the winner takes it all, but the fact that courtney taylor (leader of dw) narrates (even though it seems a good choice - it provides a feeling of seemingly closer involvement) and that bands\\' late history is represented nonproportionally (bjm is covered till 1997, and dw - till 2003), does not add objectivity to the film.third, the movie is (somewhat) shallow. what does it want to teach us? as one critic said: \"... movie examines old questions: where does genius fit into a commodified world? can it thrive and get its due, or does it need to self-destruct to preserve its integrity?\" no, it does not examine these questions! it just depicts a story of a brilliant, but unsuccessful musician, narrated by a less brilliant, but successful one, who indulges in self-assurance and eternal coolness of an ego greater than mountain.anyway, the movie was fun - it\\'s raw, it\\'s fresh, it\\'s stylish, it\\'s ... just god damn interesting, at least for the dw or bjm fans. for the rest of the crowd - i don\\'t know...',\n",

       " \"the trailer goes nowhere near and only scratches the surface of the film and rightly so too, not because it has that obligation to keep its real narrative under wraps, but because what actually transpires, will provoke entirely different lines of questioning, some of which are frustratingly not answered in the film, leaving you to your own devices to interpret the series of events. which of course means plenty of material for an after-show discussion.metaphorically, the box refers to how us humans tend to subconsciously hole ourselves into situations or things in everyday life, and how our enclosed thoughts tend to see things from a certain perspective, seldom out of the box. there's a speech made near the end by one of the characters that will leave you pondering over this fact, which governs the basis of the entire film, and even threading on existentialism, where our bodies are mere vessels for the soul, and from cradle to the grave we put ourselves in more boxes in a way of life fashion.what i disliked about the film, is how it tried to sound intelligent through the frequent name dropping of covert government agencies like the cia and nsa, as though there's something overtly clandestine about these agencies that we should be aware of. they serve little purpose other than to put every action and every person under scrutiny, that nobody can be trusted, wrecking havoc in a sense to both the characters and the audience as we try to keep up with trust issues to aid in the interpretation of the narrative. having it set in 1976, against a nasa backdrop of manned space missions, and in langley, virginia, also provided that heightened sense of wary that will sap your energies as you sit through it patiently.based upon the short story button, button written by richard matheson and made into an episode of the twilight zone, the story follows the lewis family, where husband arthur (james marsden) works at nasa and develops a prosthetic foot for his teacher wife norma (cameron diaz), and you'd think it's all happy family with their son walter (sam oz stone), until one day a mysterious man called arlington steward (frank langella in a two-face inspired facial effect) whom we are preempted of in the opening, comes knocking and giving them a deal or no deal button in a box. plunge the button and they'll get a million bucks (we're talking in dollar terms of the 70s here) although a stranger out there will die. if they don't, well the deal's got an expiry date.the story would dictate a deal be made, which of course sparks off a mysterious sequence of events that unfold, with even more shady characters (who nosebleed) appearing, some whom are inexplicably zombie like, apparently all under the influence, or employment, or arlington steward. whether or not steward is death, a clandestine government employee, a messenger from god or a representative of aliens after an anal probe, remains unanswered, so whichever way you look at it, it's as if he's delivering something expected, just begging that mankind will shake off its innate greed so that his work can be cut short and to return to wherever he came from.if you need a little distraction from the disparate scenes which make up the narrative, the production sets and art direction are gorgeous in recreating the 70s look, as you try to figure out the mystery of the consequences that stem from a result of not fully understanding the fine print. it's full circle this examination of human nature, of our greed for immediate gratification, manifesting its result in longer term pain, confusion and further choices that we'll make based on real sacrifices. nifty special effects come into play as well, though it just leaves more room open as to the genre of the film.so is it horror, science fiction, or a mystery thriller? it's everything rolled into one actually, together with a sprinkling of the philosophical. just don't go expecting a straight narrative film with clean and easy answers at the end \\x96 this is like an x-files episode on steroids.\",\n",

(i mean it took a few million years for us to evolve from monkey to man!)and finally, the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb. it was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an end, then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending. the ending also raises a lot of questions, which i know, don´t have intelligent answears. did theid learn to work the space ship?, which was power-less, and learnt to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand?, and, what did he do, breed with all the women? and lets say that that would happen, i higly doubt that history would stay the same, like washington would be built exactly like it is today! (i mean wouln\\'t there be a huge banana instead of the memorial?)well, just to say something posative about the film. some of the cast was great. helen bonham carter\\'s character was interesting and well-acted, as for tim roth as theid. he was very good, a little exaturated at some points of the film. michael clark duncan was also fine. i was not happy with marc whalberg. he is not much of an actor, and plays here a very macho colour-less character. very unbielevable and is nothing compared to hestons character in the original. and the main female character had no reason or place in the film. she was just casted for the looks. hardly said a word throughout the entire film.well, i think that in the future when people think about the planet of the apes, they will think about the original one. the latest will soon be forgotten.',\n",

       " 'the title of the film seems quite appropriate given the persona of the lead character, fanda. he\\'s an older man living in the late autumn of his life, yet frolics about as a jubilant school boy who\\'s just entered a spring meadow. the frailties of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions to him. his wife supports this idea when she observes, \"fanda laughs at funerals and death.\" in other words, death is not something fanda takes too seriously; he has more important things to do than worry about what already is inevitable. life, however, and the pursuit of living life to its fullest, is the philosophy that governs fanda\\'s existence. he is not one to merely exist, but must live for each day and each passing moment, for tomorrow is not guaranteed. the film seems to make a strong commentary about living as though there is no tomorrow, let alone death. too many people take life much too seriously and consequently miss out on the actual living part of life. fanda\\'s wife for example; she\\'s so worried about preparing for death, not in some religiously connotative way, but in a far too practical, even lifeless way that she forgets how to smile, laugh and just have a good time. her humanity seems to have transformed into zombie auto-pilot mode. fanda, to the contrary, is perhaps too blithe and absent-minded for his own good. he needs a person like his wife, emilie, to help balance him. it\\'s as though fanda possesses the invincible spirit of a child, like a kid trapped in an older man\\'s body. he is introduced as the adventurous type; he pretends to be people he\\'s not in order to get gain, squanders money, factiously lies and is always up for a good laugh. deep-down, though, he is a kind-hearted and gentle old man who wishes to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife. the two off-set each other quite nicely, though neither one of them truly appreciates the binary quality of their relationship until they metaphorically chance upon death: meaning, their divorce. it is during this courtroom scene that fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love. his wife emotionally recalls all of his flaws, yet is tenderly drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior. in this moment of her forgiving him, fanda realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife bonkers and makes an internal commitment to make her happy. ironically, though, after making this commitment he becomes what his wife later calls, \"a living corpse.\" the life-blood within him drains away as he becomes more like her\\x97a zombie going through day-to-day motions. he doesn\\'t seem to live anymore, but exist. for example, he gives up his zany pranks, doesn\\'t squander money, quits smoking on account of his wife (not his health), and overall, just acquiesces to whatever she wants of him. succinctly put, he changes on account of wanting to make her happy. thus, the binary quality of their relationship begins to slowly vanish. realizing that her husband is not who he used to be, there is a part of emilie that misses the old fanda. she misses her husband\\'s aloofness and the fights they used to have, because it was in those moments that they were truly living, not just simply existing. i believe the filmmakers were trying to get across a specific message here; that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient, but often times will take sacrifice and endurance to wade through the seemingly bad times. the possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live for every moment. life is often taken for granted, but when threatened with death\\x97be it literal or figurative\\x97people awake from their ungrateful slumbers and are aroused to start living life to its fullest. it\\'s as though they are scared that they\\'ll never live again, so they better make the most of it while they have it. fanda and emilie had been married 44 years with fights along the way, but it wasn\\'t till they were both threatened with the possibility of death-like-separation that they began to show their true colors. as the old maxim goes, \"love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.\" they both begin to see what matters most in life and that is the people they meet along the way. more importantly, the intimate relationships they make with their significant others.',\n",

       " 'dramatic license - some hate it, though it is necessary in retelling any life story. in the case of \"lucy\", the main points of lucille ball\\'s teenage years, early career and 20 year marriage to desi arnaz are all included, albeit in a truncated and reworked way.the main emotional points of lucy\\'s life are made clear: lucille\\'s struggle to find her niche as an actress, finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character lucy ricardo a legend; her turbulent, romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to desi arnaz; lucy & desi creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as tv\\'s most memorable sitcom couple.as lucille ball, rachel york does a commendable job. do not expect to see quite the same miraculous transformation like the one judy davis made when playing judy garland, but york makes ball strong-willed yet likable, and is very funny in her own right. even though her comedic-timing is different than lucy\\'s, she is still believable. the film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set, and her mistreatment of vivian vance during the early \"i love lucy\" years, but watching york portray lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusion.daniel pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real desi was, but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with desi\\'s accent, especially in the opening scene. madeline zima was decent, if not overly memorable, as the teen-aged lucy.vivian vance and william frawley were not featured much, thankfully, since rebecca hobbs and russell newman were not very convincing in the roles. not that they aren\\'t good actors in their own right, they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing. most of the actors were from austrailia and new zeland, and the repressed accents are detectable at times.although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact, there are many deviations, some for seemingly inexplicable reasons. jess oppenheimer, the head writer of lucy\\'s radio show \"my favourite husband\" which began in 1948, is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with \"i love lucy\" in 1951, completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator! this movie also depicts marc daniels as being the main \"i love lucy\" director for its entire run, completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by william asher after the first season! also, though i figure this was due to budgetary constraints, the ricardo\\'s are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in new york, when in reality they changed apartments in 1953. the kitchen set is slightly larger and off-scale from the original as well. the connecticut home looks pretty close to the original, except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured. there\\'s also desi talking about buying rko in 1953, during lucy\\'s red-scare incident, even though rko did not hit the market until 1957. these changes well could have been for dramatic license, and the film does work at conveying the main facts, but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to oppenheimer and asher, two vital figures in \"i love lucy\" history? the biggest gaff comes in the \"i love lucy\" recreation scenes, at least a few of them. it\\'s always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people, but even more so when obvious changes are made. the scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated, and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away! the \"we\\'re having a baby\" number was shortened as well, but other than that it was practically dead on. by far the best was the \"grape-stomping\" scene, with rachel york really nailing lucy\\'s mannerisms. the producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly recreating the \"vitametavegamin\" and candy factory bits, instead showing the actors rehearse them. these scenes proved effective because of that approach.the film\\'s main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about lucy\\'s life, since much is skimmed over or omitted at all. overall, though, it gives a decent portrait of lucy & desi\\'s marriage, and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively.',\n",

       " \"1956's the man who knew too much is exceptional entertainment. to those who prefer the 1934 original, i will say that that one is faster paced and wittier. however, even though the american version was (heaven forbid!) a big budget blockbuster, i believe it blows the british version out of the water. i think this is one of hitchcock's 10 best-no small feat considering he made over 50 films and many of them were among the greatest of all time. i find so many things to love:1)james stewart, america's favorite everyman for so many years, does an excellent job playing the distressed father here. he can make any film enjoyable, and working with such a likeable character in such a gripping story, he had me rooting for him very intensely. leslie banks in the original is nothing in comparison.2)doris day. yes doris day. despite all the criticisms directed toward her, i think she makes the loving wife/mother an extremely sympathetic person. i disagree with the negative remarks towards her character; just because she is soft-spoken and gentle it doesn't mean she is docile and helpless. i don't want to spoil anything, but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed. she gives the story a level of warmth that just wasn't there in the first one, and for those who care about that this version is the way to go. and i loved que sera sera; i think it is one of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard and deservedly won its oscar. it elevated the film to another level.3)the albert hall sequence. i don't think it was too long at all; i think the suspense built the whole time to that terrific crescendo and hitchcock's direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant. and the assassin was truly frightening. 4)the ending really put a smile on my face; even after the aforementioned scene was over i found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again. the last line in the film is highly amusing. i don't think the film started out slowly; hithcock was trying to get us to know and like the mckennas and he did a great job. i wasn't a huge fan of the kid playing hank, but i didn't have a problem with him. since hank was ben and jo's kid i cared about him too; it's not like he was a brat or anything. i found no major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues. way to go hitch!\",\n",

'morte a venezia' was shot over 30 years ago, and it portrays a period even further back, at the beginning of the twentieth century.life was slow then, compared to now. people were supposed to behave in a certain way, hiding their true emotions even from themselves. director visconti and dirk bogarde, the leading actor, admirably succeed in showing how the aging composer von aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a young boy. for a man like von aschenbach, in his time, this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with. we see his inner struggle, mostly on the face of bogarde, against the beautiful backdrop of venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music, composed by gustav mahler.this movie is slow, there is no denying it. no special effects, car chases or fights to keep the audience pinned to their seats. no perverted sex scenes either; the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances from afar and the occasional smile.so, basically, nothing much happens in this movie? not if you want your senses to be hit like a base drum. if you want them to be played like the strings of a violin in a romantic concerto, this is the movie to do it.\",\n",

       " \"'bluff' has been showing for a good few months at movie theatres in bogota, and today i finally got round to seeing it. i didn't really know what to expect at all, but was very happily surprised. it is a crime comedy of the same ilk as snatch etc, and it manages to nicely balance elements of suspense with comedy. the style of the film is established early on with cheerful music and the argentinean narrator who makes asides direct to camera -- odd the first time, but subsequently fitting naturally.with my less-than-perfect spanish, i still found the plot and dialogue easy enough to follow, and plenty of the comedy is situational. my colombian girlfriend was laughing a lot at the various portrayals of people from different regions and social classes which did pass me by somewhat, but for instance a well-acted portrayal of a pompous idiot in a position of power is funny in any language.i think it is to this film's credit that it has something of a global flavour: i wasn't often reminded that this was colombia that i was watching. yet it is important to note that many wealthy bogotanos do live like some of the characters in this film, and it is not a mis-portrayal of bogota or colombian society in any way, just a *selective* portrayal -- as is any film supposedly portraying a 'real' situation/culture.i don't know how much of the comedy would be lost in subtitles, but if it comes to your country definitely go check it out: it is a very slick and enjoyable movie with great elements of black humour. and all in a tightly packaged 90 minutes.\",\n",

       " 'this is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn\\'t like it. my wife has never seen it, and when i just rewatched it last night, i waited until after she went to bed. she might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but i know she would have had enough within ten minutes.head has nothing like a conventional story. the film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. it could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres. if you\\'re not a big fan of those things--psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism and the \"acid trip aesthetic\" (assuming there\\'s a difference between them), you should probably stay away from this film. on the other hand if you are a fan of that stuff, you need to run out and buy head now if you haven\\'t already.oddly, the film has never received much respect. that probably has a lot to do with preconceptions. after all, it does star the monkees--micky dolenz, davy jones, michael nesmith and peter tork--and the monkees were a musical group of actors put together by producers bob rafelson and bert schneider to be a kid-friendly, bubble-gummy beatles for a television series. in their era, they had as much respect as, say, menudo, new kids on the block, the spice girls, and so on. as a fellow imdb reviewer rightly notes--\"perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the monkees as a silly factory-made pop band rip-off of the beatles, refused to see (head)\".the monkees and head have never been quite able to shed that negative public perception. it\\'s a shame, because there was a lot of talent, both musically and otherwise, in the monkees. it\\'s probably odder that rafelson, who directs here and co-produces with schneider, and jack nicholson (yes, _that_ jack nicholson), who wrote the script and also co-produces, decided to take the monkees in this unusual direction. it\\'s as if new kids on the block suddenly put out an album equivalent to pink floyd\\'s ummagumma (1969) or atom heart mother (1970). in fact, the songs in head, written by the monkees and frequent collaborators such as carole king and harry nilsson, have a floyd-like quality, somewhere between the syd barrett era and the immediate post-barrett era. this is much more prominent than any beatles similarity. some people have complained about the music in the film, but to me, all the songs are gems. for that matter, some people dislike barrett era (or other) floyd, which is just as difficult for me to empathize with.but what _is_ head about? the basic gist is just that the monkees are taking a trip through various film genres--there are war scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenes, drama scenes, western scenes, sci-fi scenes, romance scenes, and on and on. except, in the film\\'s reality, this turns out to be happening primarily (if not exclusively) on a studio lot. at root, we\\'re watching the monkees shoot a film. of course all of the scenes in the various genres have something surreal and self-referential about them, and they, and individual shots within a scene, tend to lead to one another using dream logic not dissimilar to the monty python television show. as a dream, head tends to vacillate between a good dream and a nightmare, while often being one that would cause you to laugh in your sleep (something that i frequently do, by the way).technically, rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to realize the above. there are scenes with extensive negative images, there are a lot of very fast cuts (including a great sequence that features davy jones and tony basil dancing alternately in a white and a black room, wearing a combination of white and black reversed in each, that occasionally toggles back and forth as quickly as two frames at a time), there are a lot of bizarre segues, there is an animated cow mouth, there are odd editing devices, and so on. for my money, i wish this stuff wasn\\'t just a relic of the psychedelic era. this is the kind of artistic approach i relish. it seemed like a good idea back then and i still think it\\'s a good idea. i\\'d like to see films like the life aquatic with steve zissou using (2004) using these types of extended techniques. now that would make that film surreal.interpretationally, some folks who aren\\'t so in tune with the acid trip aesthetic have complained that it\\'s basically b.s. to offer meanings for something intended to not have any. i disagree with such a pessimistic/nihilistic view; head was intended to have a lot of meaning(s), and it\\'s not just films without conventional plots that have multiple interpretations. nicholson, rafelson and schneider have a lot of interesting things to say about the monkees--the film postmodernistically comments on their manufactured status; pop stardom--way before pink floyd, head conflates pop stardom and violence, from images of war to images of fans cannibalistically dismantling their idols; and naïve u.s.-oriented ideas of international perceptions and respect--well-armed foreigners in a desert surrender to micky dolenz just because he\\'s an american, then later they blow up a coke machine (again in the desert) for him because he\\'s thirsty and can\\'t gain access. the film comments on many other topics--from big industry to police, surveys, spectatorship (especially in relation to tragedies), and on and on. head is full of ideas, appropriately enough, with intelligent, multifaceted things to say about them.head deserves to be considered a classic--it\\'s basically shooting for the same vibe as the beatles\\' yellow submarine. both premiered in november of 1968, interestingly enough, and both were intended as something of a summation of the psychedelic aesthetic. yellow submarine wasn\\'t quite successful. head is everything yellow submarine should have been.',\n",

       " \"tyson aspect ratio: 1.33:1sound format: stereoreverent - though scrupulously fair - account of the life and times of champion boxer mike tyson. given his conviction on a rape charge, the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain, but paints a warts-and-all portrait of his rise to fame, the pressures of success, and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad. constrained by time limits, the script gallops through a succession of relevant details, alighting briefly on significant events, culminating with tyson's (temporary) downfall in 1995. novices will be enlightened by the chronology, while boxing fans will be entertained by director uli edel's straight-arrow approach to the material. he portrays tyson's life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success. in fact, the script reserves most of its venom for tyson's ex-wife robin givens, characterising her as an ungrateful gold-digger who took advantage of his naivety. production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb: michael jai white does a fair imitation of the title character; george c. scott plays tyson's mentor cus d'amato through acres of gritted teeth; and paul winfield was surely born to play don king!\",\n",

       " \"undoubtedly one of the great john ford's masterpieces, young mr. lincoln went practically unnoticed at the time of its initial release, no wonder because the year was 1939 when many of the greatest movies of the whole cinema history had been released, including the most mythical western in the history of the genre, john ford's milestone stagecoach and many others, such as gone with the wind, the wizard of oz, mr. smith goes to washington which took the oscar in the only category young mr. lincoln was nominated for, which is original screenplay.  it continued to be the most underrated ford's film for many years ahead destined to gradually fade away in the shadow of other john ford's masterpieces, but by the end of the 1950s american and european film critics and historians took a hold of a note written by legendary russian director sergei eisenstein about the young mr. lincoln where he praised it and acknowledged that if he would only have had an opportunity to direct any american film ever made till then, it would be definitely john ford's young mr. lincoln. impressed by such an undoubted preference from eisenstein, critics began to see the film again but only with a bit different eyes and film's reputation has been increasing ever since.  it was far not for the first time the life of one of the most legendary american presidents was brought to the screen. right in the beginning of the 1930s griffith did it in his abraham lincoln and the same year as ford's film, mgm released john cromwell's one called abe lincoln in illinois. curiously enough both of them were based on a very successful broadway stage play released in 1938 and written by robert sherwood.  as far as john ford's films are concerned, we can easily find many references to the life and deeds and even death of mythical lincoln's figure in several of director's works, such as 1924 the iron horse or 1936 the prisoner of the shark island, the second one, just as young mr. lincoln, utilizes as the main musical theme the favourite lincoln's song - dixie. the screenplay based on a previously mentioned stage play and lincoln's biographies was written by lamar trotti in collaboration with john ford himself, which was quite a rare thing for ford to do but final result was simply superb - a script combining elements of the play with several historical facts as well as myths and legends about the beginning of abraham lincoln's life and law practice culminating in a hilarious but mostly heartbreaking trial scene, which is the film's highest point and main laugh and tears generator, where lincoln defends the two young brothers accused of a murder and have to devise a manner to help their mother too when she is brought before the court as a witness and where the prosecuting attorney (played by donald meek) demands her to indicate which one of her sons actually committed the murder obviously obliging her to the making of an impossible choice of condemning to death one and letting live the other. overall it's a very touching, heart-warming and even funny film with simply magnificent performance from henry fonda in his supreme characterization of abraham lincoln and with overwhelming richness of other characters no matter how little or how big they are incarnated from the wonderful and intelligent screenplay and conducted by the ability of john ford's genius at one of its best deliveries ever. a definite must see for everyone. 10/10\",\n",

       " '\"love is a many-splendored thing\" is set in hong kong in 1949-50, and tells the story of the relationship between mark elliott, a white american journalist, and han suyin, a half-chinese half-european doctor. this story of a mixed-race love affair was quite a daring theme for the fifties, and, as it often did, hollywood tried to soften the blow by casting a white actress as the supposedly non-caucasian woman who falls in love with a white man, something that would be regarded as politically incorrect today but was quite acceptable then.. (think, for example, of the casting of ava gardner in \"show boat\" or natalie wood in \"west side story\") the setting of the story in a british colony was also perhaps a way of exploring racial issues in a way that would cause less controversy in america. suyin loses her job in a hong kong hospital because her british superiors take exception to the fact that she is dating a white man, whom she is unable to marry because his estranged wife will not grant him a divorce. as was sometimes the case, european colonialism was made the whipping-boy for some of america\\'s own failings. imagine the furore that would have been unleashed had a similar film been made about a black or mixed-race woman doctor in a hospital in alabama.besides racial issues, the film also raises questions of international politics, referring to both the communist seizure of power in china and the outbreak of the korean war. han suyin was a real person and a well-known author of the period; in reality she tended to support mao\\'s communist regime, but here she is shown as firmly anti-communist. this is not, however, primarily an \"issue\" movie about either racialism or politics, but rather a romance, a good example of what would have been known at the time as a \"woman\\'s picture\". such films, although mostly made by male directors, were mostly aimed at female audiences. they dealt with love and romance- often unhappy romance- from the woman\\'s point of view, and had a strong female character in the leading role. the genre often provided roles for actresses older than the heroines of standard romances. earlier examples were normally in monochrome, but by the fifties they generally, as here, used lush, sumptuous colour.although a chinese or eurasian actress would have been more convincing in the role, jennifer jones, does a very good job as suyin. i found william holden, as mark, rather uncharismatic, but this does not matter much as suyin is very much the dominant figure. she is screen much more than mark, and the film examines her family and professional life much more than it does his. although jennifer was still strikingly beautiful, she was in her mid-thirties, rather older than most romantic heroines of films of this period. holden was about the same age, unusually for the fifties when \"boy-meets-girl\" often meant \"older man meets girl\".the film is not particularly profound, but is well-made with some attractive photography, particularly of hong kong itself, reflecting the growing trend in the fifties for shooting on location rather than on studio sets. seldom can hong kong have looked so beautiful; the view from a hill overlooking the city takes on a special meaning, as this is where suyin and mark go for their romantic assignments. the overall mood is one of poignant, doomed romance, a mood heightened by the atmospheric photography and the musical score, including one of the most memorable movie themes ever written. 7/10',\n",

       " 'my first impression when i read the synopsis for the upcoming movie was that it was going to be very, very different from the book. the movie trailer said that the movie is supposed to take place when vivian is 19 years old after her parents were killed in a fire in america. she meets aiden, an aspiring graphic novelist. working in a chocolate shop in the day, she must accept that she will never be normal, because every full moon, she becomes a loup-garou--a thought-to-be mythical creature that can be closely compared to a werewolf.most of the little changes didn\\'t sound too bad to me, even though i am a fan of the book with the shared titled by annette curtis klause. i knew it would be different, but i wanted to see it to support the book, thinking that an age change, a setting change, and a few little occupation changes wouldn\\'t impact the storyline as a whole enough to make me want to tear my eyes out of their sockets and leave myself bleeding on the movie theatre ground.the movie unnecessarily killed off many important characters, one being esme, vivan\\'s mother, right off the bat in the fire that was supposed to have killed her father. i pushed that aside and ventured forth into the movie, weary and slightly annoyed. running through romania, the camera angles were decent, the scenery was beautiful, and the music was... interesting... but it left me with the impression of, \"why does vivian look like that, and why is she wearing a hoodie?\" jumping to later parts of the movie, i must say that i am surprised that the screenplay writers seemed to support incest in a way and rather than sticking to the character relationship from the book between vivian and rafe, the leader of the five now became her cousin through her (surprise!) aunt astrid, who, in the novel, was the bitter and hated rival of vivan\\'s mother, and, might i add, no way related to either of them.to top off character distortions, gabriel had somehow become the leader of the pack and obsessed over vivian being his mate so they could fulfill some nonexistent prophecy. not only did his physical appearance take a complete 180 from the description in the book, he was, apparently, also the father of rafe. yes, that\\'s right, it\\'s a nice little incestuous knot of wolfies all bundled up tight.little things that irked me were scenes like the forest hunts. there was a red-head that stood out from the rest of the crowd, the one who \"kissed their enemy\" before their prey was set free to run and be hunted. why was she there? why did she look like astrid? i suppose my mind is not vast enough to understand why such a character had to exist in the movie without any explanation as to why she existed other than to kiss pretty victims.i loved how the amoeba was completely cut out of the movie. i loved how legally entwined aiden\\'s past was, what between the supposedly dramatic scene where he was telling vivian about how his father wanted him to learn self-defense, and then beat his father up \"in self-defense\" to make him seem like such a tragic character.character 180s are a lot of fun when they are completely unnecessary. at the end of the movie, i felt as if some person skimmed over the novel, scribbled down half the list of character names, drew a few connections here and there, mentioned that gabriel was a bit of a jerk, vivian fell in love with aiden, he fears her when he finds out she is a loup-garou of the legends, and \"somebody\" is \"killed by a silver bullet\" and there is some sort of happy ending because vivian finally feels accepted by somebody who loves her for who she is.i gave this movie a 2/10 because the camera shots were relatively decent, and the casting could have been worse, but as far as directing goes, why do the loup-garous leap into the air in human form as if they want to fly (with their arched backs and penchant to leap from high places), shimmer briefly, and then fall onto the ground as wolves? the only aspects of this movie that even had me watch it through to the very-sordid, sorry ending were the wolves, the beautiful scenery, and the eye-candy boys.all-together, i must say that in order to enjoy this film at all, one must be ready for misconceptions, strange happenings that are not always explained, incestuous innuendos, and have either not liked the book, or have not read the book.',\n",

'i begged her' is also fun with sinatra showing how adept he was at hoofing. sinatra's solo songs are dull and seem to be inserted to show off his singing rather than as part of the story. fortunately there are accomplished supporting actors like grady sutton, rags ragland, carlos ramirez and pamela britton and an unlikely but impertubable jose iturbi as himself, to keep one watching.kelly is the star of the film, although third billed and it is interesting to see him interact with children, which astaire never did. dean stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and latches on to the kelly character. he also visit a school resulting in him telling the children a fictitious story of his life in the pomeranian (!)navy which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated jerry mouse. in another scene he dances a charming mexican hat dance with a sublimely grave faced little girl, sharon mcmanus, that is entrancing and sweet. very pleasant then but a bit too long. a taster of better musicals to come.\",\n",

       " \"'thursday' is a good movie but we recognize too much from other movies in its genre and therefor it lacks originality. if you have seen 'goodfellas', 'reservoir dogs', 'pulp fiction' and a bunch of other movies that were inspired by that last one you have seen almost every part from 'thursday'. there is a scene that involves torturing that has even the same dialogue as in tarantino's 'reservoir dogs'.still, it is a good movie. because not every part is taken from the same movie the complete thing has some new ideas and some nice touches. the opening sequence to begin with, is quite impressive. we meet nick (aaron eckhart), dallas (paulina porizkova) and billy hill (james le gros). they get into a fight with a clerk in a gas station over a cup of coffee and it ends with the death of that clerk and the arrival of a cop. we've already glimpsed at a suitcase with a lot of money in it.then we meet casey (thomas jane) in houston. he is married to christine (paula marshall) but used to be working with nick. she doesn't know a thing. then nick gives him a call and says that he is coming. we learn that he has screwed his friends over and the problems are about to start.what happens exactly is not for me to reveal but we meet some other characters, all interested in the money or the drugs nick also had with him. casey has flushed those down the drain.very funny moments, a lot of blood, a very funny sub-plot involving actor michael jeter and some surprises (although if you really think about it you see them coming) this is a good movie with some very fine performances, nicely directed by skip woods.\",\n",
       " 'i\\'m at this very moment debating whether i should even finish watching this \"poppycock\" of a movie. they had a pretty interesting idea, with the buried movie set, and that was it. so far this incomprehensible mess has no real story. there is the buried set, some wolf headed monster running amok, an amulet, and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is. what i would have missed, had i had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase, some really bad c.g.i., some incredibly stupid dialog, more bad c.g.i., and the hero fighting paper cut outs. other than the original idea, this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities. my mistake for continuing to watch. - merk',\n",
       " '\"envy\" is bad for a number of reasons. yes, there are unlikeable characters. that\\'s not the problem. it is that they are unlikeable and we do not care for them at all. \"the war of the roses\" featured unlikeable characters but due to proper introductions we grew to at least find ourselves interested in their fate, whereas in \"envy\" the introduction is thin, the characters are never believable, and the plot only makes things worse.ben stiller is simply repulsive in his role and i\\'m a fan of his work most of the time. stiller campaigned to have this released straight-to-video and now i can see why. the movie proposes that he\\'s \"best friends\" with jack black, but from the first five minutes we are given footage that seems to indicate stiller hates black. i thought this would develop into some sort of one-sided relationship (a la \"the cable guy\") but it never does, instead stiller insists he\\'s his \"best friend\" and i felt confused as he seemed to treat black like, well, \"poo.\" the movie\\'s plot is ridiculous but it doesn\\'t matter, because it\\'s supposed to be an exaggerated morality tale. unfortunately the message is lost in the mess. walken gives a good performance but black is off-key and annoying (and i usually find him very funny). no, it\\'s not a horrible film but i still can\\'t believe barry levinson (\"rain man,\" \"sleepers\") is responsible for this - it\\'s not one of the worst films of all time but it could certainly be a whole lot better. i wish va-poo-rize did exist - so we could make this film disappear forever....',\n",
       " \"i came to new port south expecting a surrogate movie about the columbine school massacre similar to gus van sant's elephant and certainly the synopsis in the tv guide stating that a student sociopath rebels against the system did give me that impression but this is a very boring movie where little happens so consider yourself warned the story is about maddox , a chicago high school student who decides to strike back at what he perceives to be an authoritarian regime . the major problem is that the character is underwritten and the actor who plays him blake shields is unable to embellish any script deficiencies . you have the gut feeling that maddox should have the evil charisma of hitler , saddam or bin laden but he never comes across as anything more than a petulant truculent teenager and it's impossible to believe he could rally any disciples . the subtext of you overthrow one manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious which means new port south is an entirely unconvincing drama that's not worth going out of your way to see\",\n",
