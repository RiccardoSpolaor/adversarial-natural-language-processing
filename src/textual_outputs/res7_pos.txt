I think that the movie was really good. Subject, acting and Nusrat Fateh ALi Khan's music were marvellous. Although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male-dominated culture, he has neglected Phoolan's character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her.

My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Film and alternative cinema (small hall, with uncomfortable seats; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed ) were perfect match.There were many cliches used in the film, but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really amusing. Sound was also brilliant (sometimes back being louder than dialogue).Everything seemed to be in right place. And I loved the way how after-war-time was presented. Real fun!

After watching John preform this one of a kind show, I had to share.....It was really something to watch a grown man portray himself as a child. I like the fact that with every character he "became," you could picture what they looked like. It is more entertaining when you can understand the individual. "Freak" is what real "stand up" should be. John is REAL talent.

 Being a Bills fan, I originally found it annoying that they made a filmmaking about the Bills and the losing of four superbowls. But once I began to watch, I felt frankly connected. It was actually nice to see the`` Bills`` win the superbowl, and I must say, that for a TV movie it was actually very okay done. Gil Bellows as the QB, and Jon Voight as the old-school Coach did a very fined job. 8 out of 10

 This is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie. There are multiple plots and turns. The story or the director starts problem marks on the death row or presumed crimes committed by black populations. This film is very okay directed by Arne Glimcher and the fine sensible of James Newton Howard is excellent. Strong execution of Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you wanted this one don´t miss`` TRUE offense`` or`` THE HURRICANE``. My woman and me rendered 8/10.
