I think that the movie was really good. Subject, acting and Nusrat Fateh ALi Khan's music were marvellous. Although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male-dominated culture, he has neglected Phoolan's character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her.

My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Film and alternative cinema (small hall, with uncomfortable seats; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed ) were perfect match.There were many cliches used in the film, but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really amusing. Sound was also brilliant (sometimes back being louder than dialogue).Everything seemed to be in right place. And I loved the way how after-war-time was presented. Real fun!

 My first Fassbinder was a wondrous experience. Film and alternative cinema( small hall, with uncomfortable seats; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed) were perfected match. There were many cliches used in the film, but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really amusing. Sound was also brilliant( sometimes back being louder than dialogue). Everything seemed to be in ok place. And I loved the way how after-war-time was present. Real fun!

This movie is an amazing comedy.. the script is too funny.. if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more. Though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh!!

 This movie is an amazing comedy.. the script is too funny.. if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more. Though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes neither laugh!! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have given justice to their roles. After 1994 i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this.

 A decent picture is penalty all the words. This film has the most poetic theater still reve of about people with Down's syndrome. And I am n't ruining it by mentioning you. You'll want to staring it yourself. Pasqual Duquenne is an astounding actor. I did not needed to understand a single word he said to understand his meaning. The film has a magician of it's own. After looking it I understood better that we put too much value on achievement and not adequate on the people we like. Passion and simplifies is all we need.

A series of shorts spoofing dumb TV shows, Groove Tube hits and misses a lot. Overall, I do really like this movie. Unfortunately, a couple of the segments are totally boring. A few really great clips make up for this. A predecessor to such classics like Kentucky Fried Movie.

I liked this movie. That's pretty much all I can say about it. Lou Gossett did a good job, even though I'm still very disappointed in him after all the Iron Eagle movies. And even if I was smiling on the inside when the first main teenager dies (I won't give it away) it was done in a nice, fitting fashion. Pretty much everyone in this movie does a good job, so check it out! It's another one of those movies I found real cheap, so I bought it, and I recommend the same.
