I think that the movie was really good. Subject, acting and Nusrat Fateh ALi Khan's music were marvellous. Although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male-dominated culture, he has neglected Phoolan's character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her.

My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Film and alternative cinema (small hall, with uncomfortable seats; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed ) were perfect match.There were many cliches used in the film, but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really amusing. Sound was also brilliant (sometimes back being louder than dialogue).Everything seemed to be in right place. And I loved the way how after-war-time was presented. Real fun!

 My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Film and alternative cinema( small hall, with uncomfortable seats; public had to wait while filmrolls were changing) were irreproachable match.There were many cliches used in the film, but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really distracting. Sound was also magnificent( sometimes backwards being louder than dialogue).Everything seemed to be in right place. And I loved the way how after-war-time was presented. Real amusement!

"The Usual Suspects" was superb ensemble acting; this is a collection of outstanding individual performances. I rarely buy movies, but this one is worth owning.

Walking with Cavemen, hosted by Alec Baldwin, is a look back at all the hominid (that's us!) species of the past 5 million years: who they were, what they were like, and how they died out. Along with being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have on these species, Walking with Cavemen also examines what it is that makes us human.

 The movie seemed a petite slow at first. But it select up speeding and got ok to the point. It indicated exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the`` gimmick``. I enjoyed it. It is very nearing to reality as any movie about the Atomic bombard that were to be dropped on Japan. I have recommended it to friends. I was particularly ravi with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.

I wasn't sure what to expect but am I glad I went to see this. A smart, slightly twisted comedy that makes you think. I wasn't quite sure how a director can create "nothing", but leave it to Mr. Natali and the brilliant individuals at C.O.R.E. to create another low budget set that looks real (as real as nothing can be).
