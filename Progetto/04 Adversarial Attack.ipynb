    "### Genetic Optimization Attack Algorithm\n",
    "The genetic attack algorithm's code is shown below. It creates a population of altered reviews each generation by substituting single words of the reviews of the previous population. It uses the *Words Distance Matrix* and the *Google One Billion Words Language Model* to select the best substitute candidates of a word at each perturbation. At the beginning the population of altered reviews is generated by perturbing the original one `__max_words` times. If a review of this population is an Adversarial Example it is returned from the algorithm. The next generation children reviews are created by random sampling with probability two parent reviews and by choosing each word from one or another at random. The `__max_children` best children are selected and each one of them is perturbed `__max_words` times. If one of these children reviews is an Adversarial Example it is then returned from the function. The process is repeated and if the algorithm doesn't create an Adversarial Example in `__max_gens` generations the attack fails. When a perturbation occurs stopwords, previously changed words and Named-Entites aren't considered for substitution."

Jeanine Garofalo is alleged to be the`` ugly duckling``, but the funny thing is that she's not at all ugly( actually she's a lot more attractive than Uma Thurman, the friend who looks like a model).Now, would this cinematic work if the`` foul duckling`` was really repellant? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy? In my opinion, despite the message that it wants to convey, this movie is pure grotesque. \n",
