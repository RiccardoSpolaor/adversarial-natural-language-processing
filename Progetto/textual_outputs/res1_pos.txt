I think that the movie was really good. Subject, acting and Nusrat Fateh ALi Khan's music were marvellous. Although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male-dominated culture, he has neglected Phoolan's character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her.

My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Film and alternative cinema (small hall, with uncomfortable seats; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed ) were perfect match.There were many cliches used in the film, but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really amusing. Sound was also brilliant (sometimes back being louder than dialogue).Everything seemed to be in right place. And I loved the way how after-war-time was presented. Real fun!

ATTACK SUCCESS!!!

Final adversarial sentence:
 Excellent drama about 2 disenfranchised, spoiled punks who go afoul of the federal council, each for his own reasons. One, a druggie, just wants to score some bucks for his next repairing, but the other has a far more sinister plan fueled in part by a disgust of his father. Good performances and a sexy script makes this a clockwork.

Great movie. Good acting ,a wonderful script. It's exciting to find out what the people are thinking and how they react on the situation they are in. A pity about the ending; a 'page' of text of how Nynke's life went on, instead of moving images was a poor choice. I hope this movie attracts a lot of people; it's worth it!

Final adversarial sentence:
 No bullets, no secret agents, a history that is entertaining, bizarre, and believable. Met some of the producers/ actors in this film at the theater. They seemed as interesting in person as their characters on screen. You may not hear about this movie on TV with high-dollar ad spots, but it is definitely sentence checking out. I have spent$ 8 for a movie ticket on a lot of other movie that were n't this entertaining. Looking forward to future scheme by this production company.

And even if I was smiling on the inside when the first main teenager dies (I won't give it away) it was done in a nice, fitting fashion.

This is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie. There are many plots and turns. The story or the director opens question marks on the death row or presumed crimes committed by black people. This film is very well directed by Arne Glimcher and the fine sound of James Newton Howard is excellent. Strong performance of Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked this one don´t miss "TRUE CRIMES" or "THE HURRICANE". My wife and me gave 8/10.
