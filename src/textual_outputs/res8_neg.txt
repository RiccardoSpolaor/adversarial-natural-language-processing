The message of this movie is "personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be the "ugly duckling", but the funny thing is that she's not at all ugly (actually she's a lot more attractive than Uma Thurman, the friend who looks like a model).Now, would this movie work if the "ugly duckling" was really unattractive? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy?In my opinion, despite the message that it wants to convey, this movie is simply ridiculous.

I vowed a long time ago to NEVER, EVER watch a movie that has ANYONE who EVER was a regular cast member of "Saturday Night Live". I didn't rent "Corky Romano" but I was forced by my unfailing good manners to watch it for half an hour. Then my good manners failed. Stupid, not funny. Tedious, not hilarious. Bad, not good. That in a nutshell is all I can say for this video.

This is a silly spoof of private eye thrillers as a novelist(Michael Cain)is called upon to 'ghostwrite' an autobiography of a colorful, waning Hollywood star(Mickey Rooney).

ATTACK SUCCESS!!!

Final adversarial sentence:
 The movie contains a very concise scene of Deneuve in a bathtub. She looks absolutely amazing for a lady age 56, but this is the only saving grace of the cinematic. additionally, it has a mindless, discouraged script and the lead actress has none of Deneuve's appeals. The chief apparently watched too many Peter Greenaway movies and Pola X comes across as a student's imitation of the Greenaway styles, without any of his inspiration.

Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made. The whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl, and all the attempts made to stop them. How Tom Selleck and Donna Mills' careers managed to survive this is beyond me. However, the most frustrating thing about it was THERE WAS NO FOOTBALL IN IT AT ALL! Avoid this one if possible.

Generation #4: 

Best Adversarial:
 A truly confused unexplained mess. Most things in the film look more or less like 1987, but then there are futuristic issues just thrown in, like the policeman's ray gun. And that car! The director seemed to be in love with colored lights. The only really remarkable performance was the girl who played Valerie, but since there was no cast listing, I do n't know which actress that was. This one is worth missing. Grade: F
