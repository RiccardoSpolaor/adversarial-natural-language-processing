The message of this movie is "personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be the "ugly duckling", but the funny thing is that she's not at all ugly (actually she's a lot more attractive than Uma Thurman, the friend who looks like a model).Now, would this movie work if the "ugly duckling" was really unattractive? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy?In my opinion, despite the message that it wants to convey, this movie is simply ridiculous.

Original sentence: 
This is a silly spoof of private eye thrillers as a novelist(Michael Cain)is called upon to 'ghostwrite' an autobiography of a colorful, waning Hollywood star(Mickey Rooney). At times silliness becomes obnoxious. This is not Cain at his best. Rooney is way over the top. Notable support from Lizabeth Scott, Lionel Stander and the comely Nadia Cassini. Not easy to watch.

 Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was achieved. The all plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl, and all the seeking made to stop them.

I think that this is a disappointing sequel. I miss a lot of the old characters (King Gator, Anne Marie, etc.), and I don't like it due to the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to do the characters.

 There's only one thing I need to say about this movie- the scene where Shaq is in a musical number with Francis Capra's character about wanting to be a genie; never see this film. The story is horrible, the acting is terrifying( c'mon, it's Shaq!) and I'd rather see Capra in Free Willy( equally terrifying) twice before ever seeing this theatrical.

This movie stinks majorly. The only reason I gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming. It's total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings. This is by far THE worse anime that came out of Japan. I can't believe they actually put their names on this garbage. What a rip off selling this thing for $20. If you haven't seen this don't bother. If you have, I pity you.

Final adversarial sentence:
 I absolutely loathed this movie! I was 9 when I saw it. It is the only movie I have ever walked out of in the theater. My mom, dad, and I all looked at each other during the movie and knew we were wasting our time. This movies stole approximately 45 minutes of my life. Everything about it was ridiculous. The entire premises was too warped. Being 9, I was always easily entertained. This movie proved that I could n't subject myself to anything and still be entertained.

I could have done with the seven gunslingers just staying away. This sequel should never have been done, the first did it all and better. The plot was a turkey, the acting was turkey, the direction, production, camera work... all turkey. Whoever put out this junk should be tarred and feathered. May they not return again!

Original sentence: 
A truly muddled incomprehensible mess. Most things in the film look more or less like 1987, but then there are futuristic things just thrown in, like the policeman's ray gun. And that car! The director seemed to be in love with colored lights. The only really notable performance was the girl who played Valerie, but since there was no cast listing, I don't know which actress that was. This one is worth missing. Grade: F
